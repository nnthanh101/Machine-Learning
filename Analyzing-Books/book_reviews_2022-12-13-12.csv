"What is special about the book is the sequence in which the author chose to present his thoughts. While this book is no means a guide to implementing a data driven strategy or applying machine learning in a commercial setting, this is definitely a helpful book for people who have enough hands on experience in implementing end-to-end analytics solutions and getting ready to try their hand on a strategic leadership role. Treat this like a cheat sheet to avoid pitfalls and you will be able to appreciate the presentation format.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Becoming a Data Head: How to Think Speak and Understand Data Science Statistics and Machine Learning
"IMHO, this is a really good overview of the data science industry today (circa 2021). Two things that stood out to me: 1) the emphasis on practical explanations (this is what it really means) and 2) the emphasis on pre-technical analysis components of data science (what I am referring to as the MORE framework representing consideration of missing data, origin story of data, representativeness of the data to what you are investigating, and exploration through visualization). For a day read, this was an awesome book… and probably most useful for A) data science folk concerned with delivery and communication and/or B) business folk who want to be more data-driven.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Becoming a Data Head: How to Think Speak and Understand Data Science Statistics and Machine Learning
"In a world where data continues exponential growth trajectory one needs to be able to make sense of the data. Many times people take data visualizations and statistical reports at face value. If only there was a book to help people cut through the noise of Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. The book “Becoming A Data Head” is that book that helps readers cut through the noise and hype of these new realms of leveraging data!The book provides tools and details on how readers can better understand the merits of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and overall use of data. There are also chapters on probabilities, statistics, and regression equations that help set the foundation for the more advance methodologies. I love how the authors break down these complex ideas so that readers can be skeptical and challenge assumptions. In addition readers will know how to ask better questions at the start of a project, so that the data analytics project will provide meaningful results.This book will help people work more efficiently with data scientists and communicate the problems they are trying to solve with data available to them. I highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to improve their understanding of data and the methods that can be used to analyze data sets.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Becoming a Data Head: How to Think Speak and Understand Data Science Statistics and Machine Learning
"First and foremost, I know the main author well, and I'm happy to see this book finally ""hit the shelves"". It's a book I would've greatly appreciated as an undergrad in statistics (or even graduate school for that matter), as it discusses a lot of practical aspects about being a good data scientist that my old formula-heavy stats and consulting books tended to gloss over. The authors have a natural talent in explaining complex topics to non-technical audience without all the fluff, and have obviously put a lot of thought into the examples used throughout the book (just take a look at the deep learning chapter!). The book covers a lot of important ground and the material is presented well. I think practitioners, whether in academia or industry, will especially appreciate the chapter on common pitfalls, which highlights several common problems we often run into in applied work. Parts I and II of the  book (Thinking/Speaking like a Data Head) will help build skills that are critical to applied data science (e.g., asking the right questions and thinking  about variation).  Whether you're an experienced data scientist, or just getting started, I wholeheartedly recommend this  book to you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Becoming a Data Head: How to Think Speak and Understand Data Science Statistics and Machine Learning

"This book serves as a comprehensive review cheatsheet for those who ALREADY knows and uses ML / data science in their academic programs/ daily works. It provides a good big picture of all the technics and knowledge. BUT it does not dive into the details. So if you're a newcomer to DS, don't buy this book. But as a seasoned DS practitioner, you will love this book to help brush up your knowledge.

"What you will not find in this book is a comprehensive, thorough deep dive into each topic needed to be hired as a Data Scientist. It isn't a text book to teach you those concepts.What this book does cover are the topics that could be asked during the interview process in a condensed format, as a review. This book assumes you have already done what it takes to learn the material thoroughly, through coursework and projects, and it gives you guidance on which topics are most important during the interview process, so you can sharpen those skills and have them available to be showcased during your next interview. Going through the book shows you where learning gaps exist, where concepts are a little rusty, and gives you an idea of the hierarchy of importance for the vast amount of skills required in this field. It is then up to you to reach for other resources to fill in those gaps. This book encouraged me to get uncomfortable, get out of my own way and make connections to land my first job as a Data Scientist.I highly recommend this book for anyone beginning their journey in data science.

There are so many data science related topics out there and its honestly really difficult to pick out which ones are more important than another since they are all very important. Its also very easy to go super deep in studying one topic and never come up for air.This book prevents you from doing that. It tells you which topics you should be spending the most time on for now and keeps you on the right track. It also summarizes how far you should go for each topic so you're not pigeon-holing yourself for hours.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ace the Data Science Interview: 201 Real Interview Questions Asked FAANG Tech Startups & Wall Street

"As a relative beginner to data engineering, I found this book to be a fantastic read.It delves into important core concepts, but also some smaller fields that are helpful for working with data. While the book mentions specific technologies like Airflow, Kafka, Snowflake etc., it mentions them in service of explaining the wider concepts and does not pigeonhole itself into a specific stack.I found the style of writing to be easy to follow and didn't feel confused, even when previously completely foreign concepts were being explained.The book is hefty but does not feel bloated. It's actually that information-dense and despite taking notes and highlighting info, I will be rereading specific parts to see if I can get better insights later down the line.The importance of coordinating with other people in your organization is emphasized throughout, in chapters about ""Whom You'll Be Working With"" regarding specific parts of the data lifecycle and how to try deriving maximum value in these interactions.Finally, some potential future trends in the area are highlighted, which was the icing on the cake for me.Overall, I think this is a must have for data engineers, particularly beginners to the field who will benefit greatly from the big-picture overview of what their jobs can and / or should entail.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fundamentals of Data Engineering: Plan and Build Robust Data Systems

"Here are my brief thoughts on the book ""Fundamentals of Data Engineering: Plan and Build Robust Data Systems"" (Joe Reis & Matt Housley 2022):This book seems to be an all-in-one solid foundation for DE. It's not a tutorial-like ""how-to"" book, instead it focuses on defining & describing the entire landscape of Data Engineering as it stands in 2022, laying it out and meticulously going through the Data Engineering lifecycle step-by-step so the reader gets a broad and thorough understanding of what's involved in each step.Even though Data Engineering is a really fast-changing field, the authors focused on all of the underlying principles of DE that are unlikely to change in the immediate future.Some examples of notable content (besides all of the standard fundamentals):- History - there is a good amount of focus not only on where we are now, but also how we got here and how Data practices and technology have evolved since the 80's up to 2022. So it's not just a ""here's all the shiny new tech"" book - its very much rooted in an understanding of the classic fundamentals. There's even a small section on Kimball vs Bill Inmon, lol.- The ""Designing Good Data Architecture"" & ""Principles of Good Data Architecture"" sections have really good, detailed principles and opinions on how one should go about designing data systems, This kind of fundamental info is generally hard to coherently piece together into a proper framework when just reading articles and doing tutorials.- The Storage section is really good. The authors go through damn near every possible type of storage in existence, and they go into depth with their pros and cons. This is important considering the current landscape of possible cloud solutions, distributed/streaming storage, different pricing tiers and options, etc. The section lays out the big ideas and trends in storage, as well as all of the considerations one has to make when choosing storage options.- There is a chapter specifically on ""Serving Data for Analytics, Machine Learning, and Reverse ETL"" where the authors describe all of the different ways we can serve data to a downstream stakeholder (DS, ML Engineer, Business Leaders etc) - this has good up-to-date info on what different stakeholders are likely to need, and how to work with them.- Chapter 11 ""The Future of Data Engineering"" is a forward-looking section with great insight into where the field of DE will be going in the next 5 years or so.I see this as an important book, up there with the classics like DWT (Kimball) or DDIA (Kleppmann). In fact, Fundamentals of Data Engineering is now the first book I would suggest to anyone going into this field. It covers so much of the landscape to give a well-rounded base of knowledge for Data Engineering in 2022.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fundamentals of Data Engineering: Plan and Build Robust Data Systems

"It's an excellent, even mandatory book for your Data Science shelf.  I am glad I bought it.  I am 67% of the way through reading this book.  It has nowhere near enough material on some areas, though, and is just missing some material that you need for DS.  That's actually OK because of course no single book is enough to cover everything you need to know in a field.  Look how many books you may have bought just to get an undergrad degree, and I bet it was not just one book.So here is a list of good and bad about this excellent book.Its good points:The profit curve.  After reading this book, I will never use Accuracy to select a model any more, as that's nearly a worthless metric especially when there are marginal costs and marginal profits involved in an application scenario.  The book is just amazingly good on describing how to select models based on estimated profit, and foremost the profit curve, and selected other supporting curves like ROC area under curve.The expected profit computation and the cost-benefit matrix as a partner to the confusion matrix. This is great stuff.  It's not even described in other data science courses that I have taken.Other good points:  ...And don't worry about the other good points (there are some). The profit curve analysis, and the lead-up to that, are superior.Its bad points:p.224: ""We will train on the complete dataset and then test on the same dataset we trained on.""  What follows next the rest of the chapter is just an inappropriate error analysis, because it is overly optimistic (but otherwise the techniques are great.)  The models have seen the training data.  We should never completely assess (test) -- and base the entire remainder of the chapter material -- on error (accuracy) estimates produced from data that the models have already seen.In most chapters, there is just not enough detail in the material, to enable this book to be used as a ""correct reference"" basis against which to write your own working code as you follow along with the text in whatever computer language you want to use for analysis.In summary:The book is outstanding.  It is necessary for your DS bookshelf, but on the other hand it is nowhere near sufficient.The data science course sequence by Johns Hopkins University identifies many of the elements of a nice overall outline as to what DS practitioners need to be able to do (and this is not even sufficient either):Reproducible research; Experimental design; R programming (or python, or perhaps SAS or Octave, but some mathy language for sure); Exploratory data analysis; Regression models; Statistical inference; Practical machine learning; Scientific writing; Developing data products; Big data techniques (e.g. Apache Spark programming or at least MapReduce-style programming); SQL and NoSQL databases; Concurrent, distributed, and parallel programming; Advanced statistics (such as multiple testing corrections).This book by Provost et al gives just a part of the necessary DS material.  However the part it provides, is essential.  I wish the biological data scientists in academia would adopt and integrate the cost-benefit matrix idea and the profit curve idea into their model selection techniques instead of just using the accuracy metric mostly.Also a data scientist could do several follow-on added-value extensions to the profit curve chapter.  You could produce Revenue curve (or Cost) since sometimes that matters more.  You could quickly find alternatives which are nearly equi-profitable to the optimal profit but which exhibit (less revenue, less cost) or (more revenue, more cost).  You could detail the model selection and profit consequences of fixed budgets.  You could further assess the implications of marginal profit analysis on the optimal quantity when the profitability ratio changes.  You could directly assess the data science solution against the best business wisdom solution and estimate what amount of profit is lost when using the old business wisdom decisions.  It's a testament to this book's strong value that you can do a lot more based on its material.Nice work.  Recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking
"Data Science for Business by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett is a very important book about data mining and data analytic thinking.  In 1971, Abbie Hoffman shocked the world when he demanded hippie readers (at the time, a likely oxymoron) ""Steal This Book"".  While I wouldn't go so far as to encourage current and future data scientists to shoplift, I will demand that they READ THIS BOOK!Not long ago, data was difficult and expensive to come by. Today, we're living in a world of far too much data, vast amounts of cheap computing power, and way too many poorly defined questions.  Mix them all together and you're guaranteed to make a mess.Going from data dearth to plethora presents substantive issues.  In business, the balance between gut feel decision-making and analysis paralysis is changing, rapidly.  Whether it moves too far from gut to paralysis, only time will tell. Through Data Science for Business, Provost and Fawcett offer practitioners a guide to equilibrium.Read this book and you'll find yourself moving briskly down the road towards data analytic enlightenment. While not highly technical, the authors covers each topic with enough rigor to appreciate the tools being presented and the insights being offered.From the outset, the authors are clear about the book's objectives: ""The primary goals of this book are to help you view business problems from a data perspective and understand principles of extracting useful knowledge from data.  There is fundamental structure to data-analytic thinking, and basic principals that should be understood.  There are also particular areas where intuition, creativity, common sense, and domain knowledge must be brought to bear…  As you get better at data-analytic thinking you will develop intuition as to how and where to apply creativity and domain knowledge.""This paragraph makes me think of all those undergrad and graduate students studying Statistics at Universities all over the world, my daughter included, who are being bombarded by one math or statistics class after another (Calculus III, Math Stat I and II, Linear Algebra, etc.).  Yet, far too often, they enter the real world lacking ""data analytic thinking"" or a sense of ""basic principals""  They do, however, have a sense of being overwhelmed and under prepared.  The epic battle between ""frequentists"" and ""Bayesians"", takes a back seat to what should be the real controversy in statistics departments around the world, the balance between ""application"" and ""theory"".  The book's ""primary goals"" should be the walking orders of every statistics program at any college or university anywhere.From the outset (page 2), the authors state,  ""Data mining is a craft.  It involves the application of a substantial amount of science and technology, but the proper application still involves art as well."" Absolutely true!  It's great to read this stuff!  This is followed by a concise discussion of CRISP-DM, a well-defined data mining process, whose concepts are elementary, essential, and integral to the responsible, proper, and successful practice of data mining.From this point on, the authors proceed to accomplish their primary goals.  They present such topics as predictive modeling, correlation, classification, clustering, regression, logistic regression, linear discriminants, and much more.  Their presentations are user friendly, their real world examples are interesting, and their guidance and insights are extremely valuable.My criticisms are limited to their website.  The Data Science for Business site leaves me wanting more real world examples to enjoy, access to more resources and tools of the trade, more references to peruse, and a more rigorous approach to some of the solutions.  Perhaps Data Science for Business the sequel is on the horizon?Whether you're a seasoned statistician (or, data scientist), a young aspiring novice, or an adventurous business person looking to expand his/her horizons, Data Science for Business by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett is well worth the price of admission and the reading time you'll invest.Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett state, ""[i]deally, we envision a book that any data scientist would give to his collaborators…""  I'll do them one better, I'm giving it to my daughter!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking

I'm currently on my second reading of the book in order to reinforce the concepts, and I bought a copy of the book for someone at work.So what's so good? The book is really well thought out and the grammatical style is top notch. The book leads the reader into some fairly complex topics without overwhelming you. That being said, some of the algorithms an statistical models can be a little daunting, but the book is designed to introduce the reader to a range of tools and models and not to make you an expert overnight. I found the book to be both pragmatic and concise, while covering a lot of ground.

"Context: I'm an MD, needing to communicate with data scientist to build a product.I've this far only read two chapters. My pattern-recognition ;) this far however, with an assessment that this will be applicable to the rest of the book is two-fold:1) Too verbose!Too much stuff on explaining the structure and purpose of the book. Could've been said way more succinctly, and therefore more clearly. The effect is that I start skimming.2) Not 'sharp' enough.The best non-fiction written for non-expert manages to reduce the complex into explaining the essence. Not making it simpler, and reducing crucial comprehension. But reducing the complex into its crucial essence.When going over different types of tasks; classification, regression, similarity matching, clustering, co-occurence grouping - the way they are described, there is essentially no difference between i.e. clustering, similarity matching and clustering; they're all classifications - yes, there is a difference between regression.In order for this to be truly helpful even for an absolute layman as myself, it needs to add enough crucial, essential distinctions to make the categories mutually exclusive. I can think about it, I can look it up. The book would however been better if the information was more 'sharply' communicated.So why 4-star?Because it is a beautiful balance for the amateur. Explaining basic concepts instead of trendy-applications.For future versions though, correcting for verbosity and greater specificity (essence) will make it a true winner.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking
"This book is ideal for anyone looking to understand data science, and especially those who might interact with data scientists at work.  Roughly half the book deals with the essential data mining algorithms. The focus is on understanding what the algorithms do, not the details of how they do it, so implementation details are omitted. The math is certainly discussed, but kept to a minimum, and coupled with comprehensible, plain English explanations of each algorithm. Each chapter includes a case study illustrating how the algorithm can be used for a real-world problem.The other half of the book (interspersed between the algorithms) deals with issues relating to design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment of models. Without understanding these crucial ideas, the algorithmic knowledge is useless. For example, the right and wrong techniques for evaluating model performance are discussed at length. A businessperson without adequate background could easily be misled by certain evaluation metrics, and the reader is taught to evaluate model performance with a critical eye.  There is also a chapter on evaluating and critiquing data mining proposals, which nicely ties together the algorithmic, business, and practical concepts discussed earlier in the book. Some case studies are revisited in several chapters at increasing levels of sophistication, making the book feel like a cohesive whole rather than a mere compilation of chapters. If you’re coming from a technical background, you will learn a great deal about the business and practical/implementation aspects of analytics. If you’re coming from a business background, you will gain an understanding of what your data can do for you, and how to use it to your benefit.

"Needless to say, it's the best book I've ever read that perfectly combines the technical details and high level intuition.""Big data"" might sound daunting recent days since AI, machine learning, deep learning based applications are in wide spread whenever you open your browse, turn on your cell phone or etc. But you will feel much less whelmed by reading this book. It provides you with a unique experience in that it bridges the practical business problems and machine learning models.  Roughly speaking, most of books I've read are short in either of two domains: interpretability and rigorousness.  This is fills in the hole pretty well.If you are a data science manager and want to better understand what your team members are doing, this book gives you a snapshot. If you are a data scientist with years' training in statistics and computer science, this book can help you develop your understanding of the business problems in practice and offer you a different angle of analyzing them.In conclusion, 5/5 star, a must-have book that should be on the shelf of each other wants to work in the data related field.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking
"Data Science for Business is an ideal book for introducing someone to Data Science. The authors have tried to break down their knowledge into simple explanations. I am skeptical of non-technical Data Science books, but this one works well.In the beginning we are shown the motivations for Data Science and what fields they apply to. Some examples include movie recommendations, credit card charges, telecom churn rate, and automated analysis of stock market news. The book avoids going into the highly technical parts of creating the system but gives you links for where to go.They do not really reveal the whole Data Science stack. For example Hadoop was mentioned as an implementation of MapReduce but they said going into Hadoop configuration would be too detailed for this type of book. I tended to agree, and even being a progammer myself, I thought they made the right choice to leave that out.Where the book shines is in the explanations. I am very familiar with expected value calculations and there was a chapter on this. It was a much better high level discussion than I have seen elsewhere, and they mentioned possible pitfalls of the expected value framework.I liked that the emphasis was on deciding what problem to solve in Data Science. The title of the book is appropriate as it is not just about analyzing data, but figuring out the business case. If you are new to Data Science or looking to get a high level overview this book is an great place to start.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking
"Let me first say the content of this book is great - my apologies to the authors for docking a star. That said, I should have docked more based on how the kindle version displays. Look at the size of the equation examples on the bottom half of the image with the pink highlight. Even when I enlarge the text (see the other image without a page number) the equations are horribly tiny. The image with a page number at the bottom shows you how it is displayed in a PDF version (which I had to get AFTER I purchased this from amazon). (Apologizes for not being able to give image numbers, but the pics uploaded in a different order than I submitted them).Terrible quality on amazon's part and this book is frequently used as a college text book, so knowing the equations are essential.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking
Excelente libro,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"In my personal opinion, this is a book to bridge the gap between an experienced mathematician/statician and practical machine learning. The book is more focused on describing how to implement mathematical formulas in Python than to actually explain the math behind it.I am a proficient Python Engineer and I can read the code and understand what is being done, but the author makes no effort to explain how it reached to that conclusion, or why it matters. The author does implement the mathematical formulas in Python skillfully, it misses the point of the book though.Another big problem with this book is that it assumes you can learn mathematics by just doing mathematics without understanding the why. It is frustrating to read and follow the author implement mathematical formulas without explaining why. I believe this is the case because the author DOES assume you have the required math to follow the book. I believe the author should add a section in the preface that list the prerequisites for this book:- Linear Algebra- Statistics- Probability- Vector Calculus- Continuous OptimizationAbove all, it is a good book if used as an index on where to start to understand Data Science, but it definitely doesn't fulfill the promise of being ""from scratch"". From scratch IMHO means you dive into the internals of Data Science algorithms. I had the expectation that this book was going to be more like ""Designing Data-Intensive Applications"" for Data Science where the ""why"" is as important as the ""how"". Data Science from scratch is a book about the how, with no effort to dive into the why. The book does provide the vocabulary for me to discuss Data Science with practitioners, but I didn't feel it got me any closer to becoming a practitioner myself.BTW, the fact that book is monochrome doesn't matter the font and figures are very clear and readable.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"Let me start this review by explaining clearly who this book is for: anyone who has had some form of introduction (even if concise) to programming in Python, algebra, statistics, and probability will find this book a great introduction to Data Science. While the author does a great job at having a crash course on these topics (and I even learned a thing or two here and there), I can see the contents being a bit overwhelming if this is your first point of contact with these subjects. However, should you meet the requirements I mentioned above, you'll find this book a breeze! Joel does a good job at explaining the topics using his signature brand of humor, keeping the read entertaining even in the most advanced areas.  I'd even say that this is a must read if you are considering going into machine learning, since it teaches you a thing or two in the topic as well.  Please keep in mind that the book is monochrome. If that bothers you, consider viewing the electronic version.TLDR: If you're looking for a concise introduction to data science and have a bit of knowledge of basic Python, algebra, statistics and probability, look no further than this book! Otherwise, come back once you've picked up those tools and you'll feel right at home :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"I have decided to go into data science from software engineering. I bough this book to get a ""from beginners"" guide to becoming a data scientist. I learn better from books than online.I really like the author, and the way he writes, sometimes its funny, but also its very straight to the point and dry when it comes to a ""quick overview"" on concepts and things you need to know, and I quickly realized that I need to do some ""back learning"" on a lot of mathematics. So I did have to stop reading this book and purchase some other books so I can understand what this author was talking about.Though I had to buy some other books to help be understand this book, I still enjoy this book and think once I have a better foundation in algebra and calculus, I can continue to read this book again. Also you need to have a expert level understanding of python, which I dont either, but baby steps.I would say this book is great guidline to what you need to know, but it doesnt teach you enjoy from ""scratch"" like the title says, you still need to put in the work.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
"This is a great book.  Doing everything from scratch and not just using numpy, sklearn, etc is a great way to learn what's really going on underneath.  I'm surprised how far he gets along this path.  By the end, you will have implemented a keras-like deep learning setup.  It won't be fast enough for production use since it's all using Lists underneath, but you'll be able to see how it all fits together.  Also, coming from a more typed language background, I loved the type annotations.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python

"This has been a common refrain in my review of O'Reilly books. Their technical content is, as usual, excellent and comprehensive. The quality of the printed version is horrendous. The illustrations which were created in color are printed in black and white. As a result, the illustrations are confusing and look faded and would be better off omitted entirely. The printing wanders in and out like it was done on some old dot matrix printer, and the paper seems to be of cheap quality.  Quite frankly, it looks like an international version which is usually printed cheaply so that foreign students can afford it.I'd get a subscription to what was once called Safari Online and read these books online and in color.  I'd stay away from  printed O'Reilly books unless you can verify that the printing is in color and is a quality job overall.

The content of the book itself is good, except in all black and white, which doesn't bother me personally but may bother someone else when it comes to the graphs. I think the R and Python content are both great, and it keeps the code concise and quick to the point. Great for R beginners, but for python users I would recommend a little more experience.

"Data science is put in excellent perspective in this book.  I think the book is especially oriented toward giving people interested in ""specializing"" in this field or utilizing data science some good, basic information.  As a multidisciplinary field, and one oriented toward business, government and surveillance interests, generally, it is a field that encompasses and extends into practical areas that its associated traditional area, namely statistics, has not in the past much-addressed.  Data science is an extremely interesting, technical field with broad social and ethical implications explored in this book.  Statistics is only one tool.  The authors lucidly discuss the focus on the huge amounts of valuable, unstructured data.  They point out that to make all of this useful for the goals and purposes of business, surveillance, medicine, government, etc. requires an enormous time investment in putting appropriate data together and extracting information in a usable form.  The discussion of mathematical modeling, machine learning, and the overall use of algorithms is very insightful.  The authors make it clear that data science is not merely ""deep learning"", despite the fact that the extraordinary advances in using neural nets represented by deep learning is largely responsible for much of the importance of data science today.  There are excellent perspectives of data science available on the Internet, but I think the authors of this book have provided a good supplement for this information in a deeper way.  One of the real problems in picking information out from the Internet is escaping  the ""hype"" surrounding a subject that is currently ""hot"" like data science.  This book definitely allows the interested person to separate some of the solid pieces of knowledge about what the field involves from the huge amount of ""noise"" surrounding the entire area of ""weak"" AI and machine learning.  I would recommend this book strongly to anyone seriously considering going into this field.  A point the authors stress is that weak AI, namely specialized applications, rather than broadly ""intelligent"" systems competitive with general human intelligence, has opened up a world of opportunity, promise, progress, as well as ethical dilemmas.  I personally think that data science is a great field for an enormous spectrum of technicians at all educational levels.  The book opens a window a bit on the enormous implications for our future.  It is a good start on the climb to a satisfactory knowledge of this field and its potential.  I especially recommend the book to business executives and entrepreneurs as a useful and insightful view, for developing a strategic picture of this field, that does not get into unnecessarily technical details, and is not subject to the ""hype"" and ""noise"" from the Internet.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series)

"This is a killer book for the Python and data wrangling professional, making all other books look like elementary school treatments.  I've read 7 Pandas books and 32 Python books that have Pandas sections.  Stepanie Molin's is by far the strongest, most detailed, easiest to follow, best-exampled book, and easiest to understand of any of the 39 books read.  All other books pale in comparison to this must-read book from Molin.The datasets are intuitive.  Not a boring texty book.  Instead, lots of example code appears on every single page, illustrating the features.  The story and example code flow together, not skipping around or showing disjointed points.  The chapters follow your workflow, from data ingest and EDA to data cleaning, data wrangling, visualizataion, and finally to applications.Thorough treatments are given to data cleaning, data wrangling, and data enrichment as separate topics, going into deep details on how to reshape and reindex data frames, how to do proper joins on data frames, left, right, inner, and outer, and how to do many other data cleaning and wrangling steps.  For exaple, you'll learn how to set a new index, and why you should do that.  And when inserting rows from different dataframes, you can leave yourself a new indicator column that shows you which table added the row.  Pandas has many features like this that professionals should know, and Stephanie Molin shows the ""how to"".Of course there's a GitHub link so you can download the example datasets.  Honestly, I'm only up through data wrangling - have not even reached the financial analysis, machine learning, and advanced visualization code.  I can hardly wait to work all the examples in person.  (As  you know, reading is good, but building the code is by far the most effective way to learn.)Thanks Stephanie for devoting the time to making this a wonderful detailed and usable guide on how to use Pandas to solve my customer's problems.

To be successful in data science today we need to wear both of those hats, so for someone coming from an analysis background without formal software engineering training, the book helps demystify concepts like virtualenv, simulations, source control, etc.It’s not only about learning Pandas but about using pandas in the right away.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands-On Data Analysis with Pandas: A Python data science handbook for data collection wrangling analysis and visualization 2nd Edition

"As an analyst in a cyber security operation center role, I live and breathe data. The more, the better. Pandas is a natural fit for organizing, navigating and analyzing diverse data at scale. However, if you’ve ever tried leveraging Pandas to do this, you quickly realize how difficult it can be. The documentation is ambiguous and due to the diversity of the how others leverage Pandas it’s difficult to find scenarios and code examples that line up with your needs. Enter “Hands-On Data Analysis with Pandas”. Molin does a great job at organizing and presenting all you need to get started leveraging both pandas and Jupyter notebooks.

"This is a really unusual book; I can't think of another like it, really.By applying modern statistical techniques--many of which the author developed during his meteoric academic career--to a series of datasets, Taddy highlights solutions to the real-world problems of teasing out the truth from uncooperative data.Many reviewers have commented that the book did not have enough of the usual machine learning material for their tastes.  The author comes from a statistical background, and the tools he highlights are more grounded in statistics than some of the deep learning material that a lot of readers seem to be looking for.  Fortunately, there are TONS of books catering to that segment of the readership.This book really is more about getting beyond finding correlations between variables to getting at the causal mechanisms generating data.  If you're looking to get a quick bump to your scores in Kaggle competitions, this may not be the book for you.The examples in the book are copiously illustrated with code written in base R.  All example code is available on the author's github page.  Working through the code while reading the book really reinforces the material immensely.Unfortunately, there are a few typos, including a confidence-shaking mis-statement of Bayes' Rule early on.  (Super ironic, since Taddy's Bayesian credentials are rock solid.)  Given that the author has left academia for industry, I'm guessing the typos won't get fixed anytime soon, which is unfortunate, because I really think this is an important book.If anything, I think this book sells itself short with its title.  Business Data Science is really about the craft of data analysis more generally and deserves to be read by a wide audience of statistical practitioners.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Business Data Science: Combining Machine Learning and Economics to Optimize Automate and Accelerate Business Decisions
"Reading this book makes me re-evaluate my knowledge about statistical and machine learning models. I have taken dozens of courses in statistics and machine learning at the graduate level. However, this book makes me realize that applying these models in practice is way more difficult in some sense, than figuring out the technical stuff on paper. Models, in theory, make all kinds of assumptions, and when they are applied in practice, one may see surprising results than those presented on paper.Matt's background in both academia and industry makes him the perfect author to write such a book, that bridges the gap between theoretical models and implementations in practice. There are so many tricks and notes that I appreciate, which can save me tons of time if I were in a position to implement those methods.

"I very much enjoyed reading this book- cover to cover- the 380 pages of content- and then the additional glossary which in itself is a great resource. This book is not the ""nuts and bolts"" of how you do the standard statistical tests. This book assumes you have looked at other resources for the formulas.What this book does better than ANYTHING I have ever come across (and I have come across a lot of books on statistics and analytics over the years) is to get you to understand-really understand-- the key concepts, principles, assumptions and even mindsets that underlie the use of the basic-- and foundational-- statistical concepts.Prof Spiegelhalter has a remarkable ability to write and tell stories in clear and simple ways that get you to understand the essence of the principles. He walks you through many real and relevant examples so you understand the essentials of the underlying math models and mental models, and in parallel, that you also understand common mistakes and misconceptions.Some of you might say-- why do I need to visit-- or more likely- revisit these basic-- and ubiquitously applied- principles and methods? After all, isn't this becoming increasingly automated? Can't I just ""trust"" the outputs of my AI-enabled analytic systems?Exactly because the use of statistics has become so widespread, so deeply embedded in so many analytics and prediction systems-- it could never be more important than now to understand why people (and the models and systems they design) SO OFTEN misunderstand and misapply the basics. And these basics are foundational. They underlie so many aspects of modern analytics--- and even modern AI-based systems ultimately end up using these basics.All I can say is--- even though I have a MSc in Stats from Carnegie Mellon (1981), and have been involved with the use of data, statistics, analytics, and AI applications for decades-- I found Prof Spiegelhalter's way of walking a reader through the essentials of statistical thinking to be a joy to read. It has tremendously helped me to clarify my own understanding and mental models per statistical basics.This book truly works for people at ANY level. If you are just beginning with statistics- and you know the formulas but you still don't have the intuitions and insights- please read this book.If you work with stats on a regular basis--- EITHER because you are part of a team that uses statistical methods in your work products--- OR--- you regularly REVIEW work products that provide the results of analytic models-- You will find this book invaluable.And if you have to get other people to understand how to apply and how to NOT misapply basic statistical principles- this book is a hugely useful resource.Thank you Prof Spiegelhalter for producing this work. It is so easy to read. So easy to understand. And at the same time, so insightful, and so thoughtful-- in so many practical ways.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data

"This is a nice analysis of not only statistics, but in many ways of the media as well. Media can twist study results to create a headline, but upon closer look what's declared in the headline is not really accurate because you have to ask a questions to see if the results / headline is significant. In terms of the theory behind the statistics, it's not a book that goes into the details of the equations. The equation may be listed or referenced, but not really explained, which is to be expected since entire courses are taught in order to understand and work with these equations. overall, a nice take on study results and really makes you think to ask questions when seeing study results reported in the media; quite relevant during these times, indeed.

"Even if all you learn is some cool quotes (like the one in the headline), the UNIX tr(1) command, and what the word ""chimera"" is and how it relates to SQLite's data type enforcement, you never get cheated buying or reading one of this guy's books.Dr. Mertz is an intelligent, conscientious author who makes for a good read.

"This is a very nice book.  I am looking at it for an overview of things to think about.  This seems like a good reason to look at the book as the author states: ""everything within this book is meant to provide inspiration for ways of thinking about data science problems"".Part I: Data IngestionThis section identifies and discusses potential issues with and benefits of different formats of data sources; for example, csv files, relational databases, Excel files, JSON files, and other types of databases like MongoDB and SQLite.  I think the coverage of the different types of data stores is very nice and interesting.  The author provides code in R and Python (one of each for each problem), and also mentions that command-line tools are very helpful; such as bash and awk.  The concept of versioning data is introduced; for example, if you decide to drop rows which don't have complete data, you could assign a ""version"" to that modified-from-the-original data set, as well as version the script used to manipulate the data, for reproducibility.  Mentions the ""fluent programming style"".  Mentions Python Pandas commands, like: DF.melt() to convert a data frame from wide to long, and read_fwf() for reading fixed-width formatted lines of data.  Gives examples of extracting data from tables in a PDF file.  Mentions that Pillow is the Python library for reading in images as numeric arrays, and that it is backward-compatible with the deprecated library PIL.Part II: Anomaly Detection, Data Quality - for anomaly detection, this section discusses issues with individual data points, such as missing data and the various ways of representing a missing value, miscoded data, data outside expected fixed bounds, outliers, and misspelled words and names.  The discussion includes things to consider and tools to use.  For data quality, the focus is on systematic bias, which could be introduced during data collection, issues of units and scale, and validation.  Based on data quality, the data scientist may have to make the call that the data is ""not usable for the purpose at hand"" and ""cannot support any conclusions"".  If data is missing in a biased way it can present a significant problem.  The importance of normalization and scaling is emphasized.  An example is included to emphasize the motivation for normalization.  ML models can be negatively impacted if these steps are not taken.  In Python scikit-learn can be used to perform normalization; two approaches using the same API are MinMaxScaler, and StandardScaler.  Validation steps can result in asking domain or problem specific questions.Part III: Value Imputation, Feature Engineering - For value imputation, the author mentions an article ""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data"" by Halevy, Norvig, and Periera, which talks about how very large datasets solve problems for us.  Sampling of a dataset is discussed.  For feature engineering, fuzzy matching, basic NLP, decompositions (like PCA), polynomial features (computing interaction terms) and feature selection are discussed.Part Closure:  a book summary wraps up everything discussed.  This could be a good place to start, to get an overview of the topics.The book's Glossary provides a quick way to check and add knowledge.  For example, there is an entry for Berkeley DB, ""an open source library for providing key/value storage systems.""For those wanting to practice with data, Exercises are embedded, with links to data.The book has an index, which like the Glossary, can give you a fast way to look up topics.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaning Data for Effective Data Science: Doing the other 80% of the work with Python R and command-line tools
"Written by my husband, Alex Martelli. We share an Amazon account so he was logged in as me when he submitted the review....I started reviewing this text with very high expectations.First, I know the author, and I know he thinks sharply and writes engagingly, convincingly, and clearly, to present his thinking.Second, I'm convinced that the subject is vital, yet apparently sadly neglected in the literature and academic courses -- I've seen offhand estimates (applications of Pareto's Law, maybe?) that 80% of the work of a typical data engineer (I shun the phrase ""data scientist"": the use of ""data science"" instead of ""data engineering"" in the book's title is my only substantial quibble with the book!-) is acquiring, verifying, cleaning, and preparing data, and only 20% is actually applying statistics, machine learning, or other forms of analytics.Whether that Pareto-like 80% estimate is accurate or just a bit abundant, the parts of the job covered by this book are nevertheless the majority of how we spend our time and effort.And yet, all fellow practitioners I've discussed this with have learned most of what this book teaches ""on the job"" by trial and error and/or mentoring by more experienced peers, rather than academic courses, seminars, tutorials, or books.Typically, starting on a book (or most anything else in life) with very high expectations is a recipe for disappointment, as the book (or whatever) may fall short of your high hopes for it.This book, for me, was an exception: my high expectations were vastly surpassed, indeed ""run rings around""! by what the book delivered to me. If I had to rate the book on a scale from 1 to 5 stars. I would refuse... because even 6 stars would not be enough!-)The book is highly pragmatic yet quite usefully structured and sequenced. I met almost all the topics I would expect (among the few exceptions, minor ones such as protocol buffers as an important data format and the use of wget and curl rather than a couple of funky text-only browsers to get from the web HTML to scrape)... PLUS, I've actually LEARNED stuff I could have used myself in the course of a few years of professional practice... but didn't realize on my own, and was never taught (for examples, usable heuristics to detect -- and possibly correct -- sampling bias in one's input data sets).Some of the issues the book covers are elementary to intermediate, some of the others are wickedly advanced (such as t-SNE -- the book does not delve into its theoretical underpinnings, it just shows how to use relevant Python and R packages)... but both kinds will stand you in good stead as a data-engineering practitioner, by whatever name you refer to your craft (""analytics"", ""business intelligence"", ""data science"", or whatever!-).I could, of course, add some quibbles to try to show I'm not a fanboy...For example, the author's observation that ""edit distance"" for strings is not transitive (if the distance between A and B is 5, and that between B and C is 5, then the distance between A and C can be anything between 0 and 10) also trivially applies to Euclidean distance on a plane (or a sphere, AKA Haverstine distance)... yet nobody's ever argued that Euclidean/Haverstine distances between points on a plane or sphere are not a proper metric (!).But, that would be supererogatory on my part! I'll rather close with the practical observation that I'm strongly urging every colleague I interact with, who has anything to do with data processing (with my job at Google, that's most of them:-), to buy and study the book: it WILL be well worth their time and energy!Alex Martelli, author of Python in a Nutshell and the Python Cookbook (eds 1&2)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaning Data for Effective Data Science: Doing the other 80% of the work with Python R and command-line tools

"About This BookThis is a crucial book thanks to the deluge of data we currently have and use in our software applications. It looks at both structure and content issues with data of various types and the pros and cons of methods to clean it enough to be useful.Who Is This For?This is a useful book for anyone who imports data into their application, which is a good number of us. Given the Python and R code in the book, it’s good to have some knowledge and experience of one of these languages, but that’s about all you need to know. I personally recommend anything earning a computer science degree to work through this book around the same time they learn about data structures and algorithms.OrganizationThe overall organization of this book follows a standard data pipeline that you might set up for your application and what cleansing issues you might need to resolve along the way. This is, in my opinion, a great way to set up the book. Within each chapter, you have your topics, the exercises, and then a summary for the chapter. All in all, this is a well-organized book.Did This Book Succeed?I believe that the author did a tremendous job on a difficult and large topic. This is one of the most time-consuming and least talked about portions of any data pipeline for data science and machine learning tasks. It is also one of the most important. Anyone working in data or AI needs to read through this book and learn how to implement its processes in order to have cleaner and therefore more useful data.Rating and Final ThoughtsI give this book a 5 out of 5.It is useful, timely, and well organized. While it may not be set up like a cookbook or reference, it can use used as such. It is well suited as a textbook either for a course or self-study.

"For the most part data analysis is fairly straight forward. Sure you might do some transformations and engineer a feature or two, but then it’s on to descriptives, correlations and interesting visuals. What’s not so straight forward is getting your data sets into a form to perform the analysis. Any data scientist will tell you most of the work on data is done on the form if cleaning and preparing it for analysis.One of the biggest problems analysts face is the diversity of data and data sets. For every new data set you encounter there are new challenges. Mertz starts off by trying to separate the data problems into two broad categories and then generalizes approaches to dealing with them. Sample data and vignettes throughout are easy to follow and give concrete examples of problem data that can be applied to solve similar problems encountered in the work place.Tools employed in the book are probably a little Python focused, but nearly as many examples of R code and command-line tools as well as SQL/NoSQL, and everything is well documented and easily accessible on github.Everything is run in Jupyter notebooks which whether or not you are a big fan is super convenient as you don’t have to switch around to different interfaces. Stylistically I prefer less “cryptic” variable names particularly since we are working with Python quite a bit and there is a lot to be said for self-documenting code but otherwise is a great reference and packed with a variety of examples and snippets you are not likely to find in many other places.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaning Data for Effective Data Science: Doing the other 80% of the work with Python R and command-line tools
"Unlike the discipline of data science, which has an ever expanding universe of books, blog posts, and tutorials explaining its theory and practice, data cleaning (or data engineering) has lagged behind. Far more time is usually spent in extracting, cleaning, normalizing, even fixing the data that ultimately feeds the data scientist's experiments and models than is spent on the ""data science"" itself. And yet, that discipline of data cleaning has so far lacked a good comprehensive resource to teach newcomers about the constructs, practices, tricks, and traps that some of us have had to learn the hard way over many years of experience.Data Cleaning for Effective Data Science is the first book I've seen that really meets that need, and it does so impressively. It's well written and literate, with quotes from Marx and Walt Whitman to the Who, it's well thought out, with coherent and understandable explanations of both the structures used in handling real world data and the many ways things can go wrong, and it's comprehensive, with practical coverage of the many aspects of managing real world data, including a glossary of more than 30 pages with solid explanations of the terms and platforms you're likely to encounter.When I give talks about data cleaning, I'm always asked to recommend a book on the subject, and I never have had a really good answer. No more - from now on I'll be recommending this book without hesitation.

"This is a long overdue book about what may be the least talked about aspect of Data Science. The book is about the 80% grunt work of data cleaning that necessarily precedes the 20% coolness of model building and hyper-parameter selection. Nevertheless, if you came to this book looking for a neatly cataloged set of data cleaning recipes, as I did, you may be disappointed. The author obviously has lots of experience in data science, and many of these techniques have user stories associated with them, so while the book describes many cool ideas for data imputation, detecting sentinels, feature engineering, etc., they are often preceded by or mentioned in the context of one of these user stories. This makes it harder for the reader to find information about a specific technique, but ends up providing a richer understanding of the technique once it is located. You will also end up learning many tangentially useful things in addition to data cleaning techniques, such as file formats for various data sources.Overall, I thought that the book was useful, especially if read from cover to cover, as I did. Coverage wise, the main focus of the book is tabular data. There is some information about techniques for cleaning text data, but it’s not nearly enough.DISCLAIMER: I was asked by the publisher if I would be interested in reviewing the book, and I was provided with a free review copy of the book to do so.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaning Data for Effective Data Science: Doing the other 80% of the work with Python R and command-line tools

"Ms. Clarke's follow-up to How to Win With Data Visualizations is a highly useful work that now has a place in my supplemental teaching curriculum. Focused on the processes students need to master to use data effectively, her informal yet informative style leads the reader through the basics of data science in a manner that I have found effective with my students. Well covered topics include the nature of data science, what variables are and how they are used gives a solid foundation for subsequent topics. Particular attention is paid to the nature of data collection (critical in the lab science courses I teach) and how to organize it for later use is well structured. An interesting discussion of ""cleaning your data"" emphasizes something most students seem not to understand when they arrive in the class. Simply put, too many learners figure that if they glean data (from the Internet most often but also from their own labwork or studies) that is the end of it. Ms. Clarke marries the concept of data healthe to personal health and thus makes an excellent connection. She suggests a process that is workable and in practice in my classes in the spring of 2022, yielded a more solid approach than I had used previously.Subsequent discussions build on the foundations Ms. Clarke established earlier on and give the reader fertile ground to grow and individualize their own understanding of how data can be put to one's use be it in education as I do or running a business (which I used to do).Overall I would recommend this work for those interested in upping his/her/she/them/etc.'s skills in data usage.

"Review in a single sentence: An excellent combination of width, depth and humor. The humor part comes mainly from the cartoonish artwork and the ""story"" of a company growing and scaling up their data-game. There is enough width in the material to give enough information why each part of the infrastructure is needed and depth on each part of the infrastructure to get a proper view of it, while the dedicated focus is in the Metaflow and how it can be used as a part of the infrastructure.The book starts with generic discussions about needed infrastructure, developing environment and workflows. In my opinion this is excellent as it gives a view across the divide between science aspects and engineering aspects, everyone can benefit on knowledge of the other parts in the chain. After this we go into the Metaflow itself, starting with the basic flow handling, including splits and joins, of the model. This is then followed with scaling and fault tolerance and how the Metaflow handles these. Next stop is the production, here the focus is on stability. After this we go to interfacing with larger datasets, like stuff in the cloud. Second to last section is the using and operating the models which focuses on the differences between batch, streaming, and real-life applications. Last section is building and training a machine learning model with the infrastructure stack described in the book.As I mentioned, there is lots of width and depth in the book, even on the sections primarily focused in the Metaflow and they are useful even without Metaflow bits by themselves.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Effective Data Science Infrastructure: How to make data scientists productive
"As of August 2022, there are two essential books on MLOps (in my opinion):- Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen- this bookWhile Chip's book thoroughly describes the ""what"", this book tangibly describes the ""how"". As one would expect, this book focuses heavily on the Metaflow platform. However, it does a nice job of not only providing abstractions of how a generic data science ecosystem should function, but it also provides significant value on top of what is currently present online via the Metaflow documentation. My biggest worry prior to reading this book was that it would just be a rehash of the online Metaflow docs. This is certainly NOT the case.This book will be most valuable for those people evaluating MLOps/Data Science platforms and considering Metaflow as an option. Spoiler alert ... you probably won't find a more powerful, yet parsimonious, platform in the open source ecosystem. The thought processes around Metaflow's design and implementation as well as example use cases executed on the platform are all found within the pages of this book.Disclosure:I was both an early reviewer of this book as well as an early adopter of the open source Metaflow stack.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Effective Data Science Infrastructure: How to make data scientists productive

"Easily a book that could have been a five-star contender, unfortunately, there are some shortcomings.Overall, the text is a fine (but basic) introduction to data science through applications of common marketing analytics to problems such as: engagement, conversion, retention, churn, recommendations, forecasting, segmentation, experimentation, lifetime value, etc.What it does well is that it provides exposure to a wide range of applications of data science techniques to some pretty good datasets that somewhat replicate what you'd see out in the wild. The author also shows some data manipulation and aggregation techniques that I was not familiar with, like the use of ""Groupers"" combined with timestamp resampling inside of ""group_by"" operations. His notebooks are all neatly organized in the book's repo and the code is very readable.From here on out, the book is a bit of a letdown. The most salient of its shortcomings involves the depth (or lack thereof) of its exposition when it comes to the technique or algorithm being discussed. There are a couple of simple formulas here and there and very short explanations of what the algorithms are doing behind the scenes. I guess that's ok if it is meant to be an intro and not a full-fledged encyclopedia, however, I cannot overlook the sidestepping of common pitfalls and best-practices when it comes to leveraging these techniques in other places.For instance, in chapter 6 (collaborative filtering) the author walks the reader through the application of user-user and item-item collaborative filtering using unary matrices and cosine distances, without mention of assumptions made of the data (you need a lot), on the shortcoming of the technique (collaborative filtering doesn't work well for new users or new items), why you'd want one vs. the other (user-user CF is much more computationally expensive than item-item since one is more likely to have more users than items), or why you'd use cosine distance vs. Pearson (mean centering), etc. This is pretty much the case in each section.There are some editing quibbles as well. Chapters 5, 7, and 8 are pretty much rehashed from earlier chapters, so there's no reason why the material couldn't have been consolidated.Also, I wonder what the folks at Packt were thinking in packing essentially the same book twice into the same print - one for R and one for Python. If you are a Python user, then half of the book is dead-weight (the R chapters and vice-versa). Why not have ""Hands-On Data Science for Marketing with Python"" and ""Hands-On Data Science for Marketing with R""?I have no issues recommending this book to students in an introductory class as long as there's some adult supervision.

"This book is an invaluable resource for the Python student who has already acquired some proficiency with the structure of Python and the basic methods it provides for analyzing data.Python is a language that has proven to be extremely useful for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing large sets of data—and it can also be used to create predictive models to give stakeholders the detailed information they need to make vital and potentially risky business decisions.  For this reason, Python is a skill that businesses increasingly expect their data experts to have—and there are plenty of online courses, boot camps, and other resources for those who want to learn.Most of these courses will be focused on the technical details of how to manipulate data—how to pull summary statistics, joining, sub-setting, and pivoting dataframes (tables), along with creating visuals—charts and graphs.  Learning the code — its structure and various functions —- to perform data analysis is a bit like learning a language one word or sentence at a time; working at this level of detail, the student can rarely see the larger picture, and when it comes time to tackle a real world data problem, she’ll have many techniques at her disposal, but she might not have a clear idea of where to start.Data Science Projects With Python provides the Python student with a framework for tackling a real world data problem, from the beginning phase of exploring and cleaning the data, to interrogating it to discover insights from it, and ultimately to use modeling to predict the outcomes of various options, and then packaging and presenting those insights to stakeholders.Because the book is structured around a particular project, and takes the student through all its phases, exploring code and techniques that are relevant at each stage, it provides the context in which various bits of code the Python student may have already encountered can be best used—and in doing so, it gives the student the complete picture of how Python is actually used in a real-world business context.At each stage of the project, the book takes the student through essential code to be used in that stage—and so it provides an excellent reinforcement of skills, functions, and techniques the student may already have encountered, but now within a real-world business context—and this is a perspective that very few Python courses, which are focused on the details of code, will have time for.I would recommend this book for all Python students who want to understand just what using Python “on the job” will entail.  By working through the project in the book, which is completed in a Jupyter Notebook, students will find that code they’ve already learned will be enriched by an understanding of exactly when to use it, and what it’s best for, and they will also find they’ve been given a solid framework for tackling other business data problems; they’ll know where to begin, how to conceptualize the problem, how to analyze and make valuable predictive models that can be used again and again, and how to present their work to the stakeholders.Anyone serious about a career in data science or analysis will find this book an invaluable, practical resource.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science Projects with Python: A case study approach to gaining valuable insights from real data with machine learning 2nd Edition
"In the interests of full disclosure, I was asked to review this book by the publisher. The opinions of this review are mine and have not been influenced by the publisher or the author. In other words, this is my opinion of this book and my opinion alone.Overall,  The book starts off letting the reader know what knowledge they need before beginning the book.  I found it quite helpful in understanding what the author intends when certain words and phrases are chosen.  Is the author using a phrase in an academic sense or more informally?  Well, this book is smack dab in the middle.  The author does a really solid job of bridging the gap between theory and application throughout the book.  You won't get much from the book if you are already knowledgeable in data science, nor will you get much if you don't know any programming.However, if you understand programming and want to learn data science and analysis, this is a great book for you!Chapter 1This chapter introduces us to data cleansing in a very readable style.The chapter starts off simple and gives us the basics.  Even though it starts off simple, it's not simple-minded nor does it talk down to the reader.  If you are new to programming, you may have some trouble, but the author does warn you in the preface.  A little programming experience will go a long way in getting through the first chapter.The way the chapter is written feels like a story or a journey that we are taking along with the author.  I found it to be a compelling way to introduce the concepts and libraries, giving each a purpose, then digging deeper.My major criticism of the chapter is that it's a bit long.  I would have preferred it broken into two chapters, data cleaning and statistical exploration.  That said, the two topics really intertwine considerably, so I understand why they are intermixed.  The author does a pretty good job of separating the concepts even though they are intertwined in the text.Chapter 2This chapter starts to get into model evaluation, i.e., how good the model is at predicting target variables. It discusses a pretty narrow selection of logistic regression models but provides a clear explanation of the confusion matrix as well as a decent explanation of the ROC curve.There was one minor problem with this chapter, only with the pdf version.  Some of the code in this chapter was rendered as an image, so I couldn't cut and paste it.  Another minor criticism is that the ROC is shown for the data with an explanation as to why this isn't very good. Then there is an explanation of what a good ROC curve should look like, but there isn't an example.The remainder of the book follows the same pattern.  A well-written journey through the data exploration, a brief description of the underlying concepts, simple, easy to follow code, then wrap up.To conclude the review, this book is a solid introduction for programmers who want to get into data analysis and machine learning.I'd recommend it for anyone with at least a basic understanding of programming languages.  It does not go into theory in any depth, so if you're looking for that, you'll not get it here.  What you do get is a clear presentation of basic concepts, code, and examples.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science Projects with Python: A case study approach to gaining valuable insights from real data with machine learning 2nd Edition
"Before I begin the review of this book, I will begin by saying that I was asked to review this book by the publisher.  The opinions of this review are mine and do not come from any undue influence by the publisher or the author.  In other words, this is my opinion of this book and my opinion alone.A good data science book, to me, is something that you can learn from that plugs in a hole or supplements what you have learned or have been taught.  This book does this.  This takes a classic data set that you can find on the UCI data warehouse and explains in detail all of the steps to make a good data science project that you can use a project for your portfolio.  The author does a great job walking the reader through a data science project step-by-step, from data acquisition to reporting your findings to a client.  The book has seven chapters, which is the appropriate length for a book like this.The book does have some prerequisites.  You must have some understanding of Python programming and some statistics knowledge.  The author does give a brief review of these concepts in the Preface, but you should come prepared.The project that the author walks you through is whether or not a person will default on a credit card, which is a classic data set.  He walks you through on how to get the dataset, load it into Anaconda, and how to work with it.  I will say, however, that most of the loading commands when loading the dataset use the Linux (or Apple) OS for loading.  For Windows users, you have to use the dreaded double-slash notation for accessing files on your drive.The author also gives the reader some challenge exercises to do on their own pertaining to the dataset, with the solutions found in the Appendix or on the book's github page.  The exercises help the reader test some of the concepts found in the book while allowing the reader to work with the dataset.  There is no jumping around with different datasets, except where the author is trying to explain some important algorithms found in the book, such as Decision Tree or XGBoost.This book is a worthy addition to any Data Scientist's library.  While there are a few errors in the book, these are minor and it shouldn't detract the reader from completing the project in the book.

"This is a big book, and it covers a ton of content in a fair amount of detail. That said, it does not start from scratch. You'll want to have some footing in basic Python before you get started, like understanding a few different object types and control flow. Also, the author covers basic instructions about how to create a virtual environment and install packages there, which isn't difficult, but if it's the first time you have ever done it, you might want to read a blog post on the topic to explain a bit more about why virtual environments can be useful.The book was not as project-oriented as I was expecting from the title. I was expecting to complete smaller projects throughout the book. Instead, this is about doing a full data science project, from exploring and cleaning data, to selecting a model, and delivering results. This isn't a good or bad thing, it just wasn't what I was expecting, so I wanted to include it here so you would know what you were signing up for :)If you like formulas and prefer to learn about machine learning in mathematical terms, then you'll love this book. It's not a math book, but it talks about log loss, cost functions, and briefly mentions derivatives while talking about gradient descent. I do not consider myself ""mathy"", so that element of the book did not resonate with me, but I know it really suits others well.The main benefit of this book is that it provides a lot of code snippets that can be lifted and used in future data science projects. It covers a TON of material, so you'll want to keep it around as a reference as you move forward with other projects!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science Projects with Python: A case study approach to gaining valuable insights from real data with machine learning 2nd Edition
"This book walks you through the concepts of statistical machine learning. I like that it starts with the mention of Conda environments, Jupyter notebooks, talks about the most popular libraries and algorithms, and also mentions the SHAP values (new knowledge for me, thank you). The examples are real and interesting.This book should not be the only book on data science you read, but it is certainly worth checking. It touches on many different aspects of a data science project ( including presenting it to a client ) and you might discover something new for yourself.Given the book contents, I feel that a chapter about deploying machine learning models in production is missing. Also, since it already talks about  Conda environments, I feel that it would be great to elaborate on that. I had to learn about the importance of managing python environments the hard way.Overall, good book!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science Projects with Python: A case study approach to gaining valuable insights from real data with machine learning 2nd Edition
"My review is based on the pdf version of this book. I was interested in the subject matter, having recently completed a data science bootcamp. While searching for a job in the field, my goal has been to reinforce and deepen the lessons I learned through my formal training. This book provided me with an excellent way to do that.The case studies are well explained and even though my perspective is that of a person who has had some exposure to these concepts already, I think that this book could be a great way for a motivated beginner to start working with python as a data science tool. I appreciated that the authors took time to walk through some elements of setting up a good data science environment that I had not seen covered elsewhere.One of the most difficult aspects of data science for me, as a career changer, has been learning how to discuss nuanced topics such as the bias-variance tradeoff (covered thoroughly in this book) and the kinds of challenges different datasets present. The way this book is written is very straightforward and I think it will be helpful to anyone who has the same aspiration I do: to become more comfortable talking about these concepts that are so well expressed through math and visualization. I like that the book takes a practical approach by introducing scikit-learn early on. The chapter on XG boost was pretty helpful to me as well! As you work with the projects in this book, you are able to do some powerful analysis quickly. The supplementary materials available in the repo also serve as an excellent reference. Just because of personal preference, I am considering purchasing a paper copy of this book. Any code you would need to reference in the projects is available digitally",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science Projects with Python: A case study approach to gaining valuable insights from real data with machine learning 2nd Edition
"As the title said, the book is very practical with several in-depth case studies and brief mentions and explanations of the math behind the algorithm, such as loss function. It's a great book to start for students who just graduated because this book provides a practical example to translate theory into practice.The book begins with the discussion of data science project environments, such as Conda environments, Jupyter IDE, and must-have libraries. The data exploration is thorough and the ""whys"" are explained step-by-step, so the reader doesn't wonder why certain steps/measures are taken.The most valuable aspect for me is the case studies. The case studies are discussed in detail and this book covered time series, logistic regression, decision tree, boosting, etc. This book doesn't have a lot of examples, but each example is discussed in-depth. It's a great starting point and initial resource for Data Science beginners.Not only the book provided examples of data exploration and modeling, but this book also provided post-modeling analysis and visualization, as well as practical tips, such as out-of-time testing for time series analysis, how to interpret ROC curve, how to reduce overfitting, etc.In summary, it's a great and handy practical data science resource if you already have the math foundation nailed down. It's important to run the Python lines step by step so you will understand what codes are doing (if you are a beginner to Python).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science Projects with Python: A case study approach to gaining valuable insights from real data with machine learning 2nd Edition
"(Note: I'm also a technical editor of data science books, though not for this publisher.)I'm a big fan of several data science and machine learning books, most notably Francois Chollet's excellent Deep Learning with Python and Aurélien Géron's Hands-On Machine Learning -- where these books tend to fail, because their primary focus is on theory, is having enough real-world examples with walkthrough's of ""what exactly does that mean and why would I do that.""In my opinion, this book is written for those who are getting little stuck between theory and action.This book takes the opposite approach - it's light(ish) on theory, but extremely practical.  Running through this book from front to back is like having a great co-worker who's done it all before -- it takes you through what questions you should be asking to get you to the point that you understand what to do next, then shows you the code that makes it happen.  It takes you through the full lifecycle of a project, which is helpful in real world situations.Reading the book is similar to a boot camp... you'll come out with a lot more hand-on practical experience than you came in with.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science Projects with Python: A case study approach to gaining valuable insights from real data with machine learning 2nd Edition
"This book presents an excellent overview of machine learning techniques and libraries available in Python. This intermediate/advanced level topic is made easy to understand via a rich set of exercises and detailed, plain English explanations of the code. (Due to these explanations, even someone just starting to learn Python will be able to understand the code and get value from this book.)One of the important parts of machine learning is having a good set of data and the book begins by presenting a reasonable real world data set that is dirty and then walks you through how to clean it step by step. If you haven't done data cleaning before, this section serves as an excellent tutorial on this seemingly simple topic.The next several chapters discuss various machine learning libraries available to python and offers several code examples plus ample explanation to have an understanding of them, what they do and how they are used. There is some math in the book but it is minimal - just enough to explain some concepts.The last chapter pulls it all together by walking through a ""real world"" example with the techniques learned and offers an explanation of the results and the insights they deliver.All in all, this is a great book to get you up to speed on the power of machine learning techniques.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science Projects with Python: A case study approach to gaining valuable insights from real data with machine learning 2nd Edition
"I've read this cover to cover and I think it's a great book, and it's worth a read. Winning something on Kaggle is notoriously difficult (especially these days), but this book offers a glimpse into the minds of Kaggle Grandmasters. Is there a secret sauce? Not really. It's just a lot of hard work. What particularly I liked about this book? I really liked chapters on hyperparameters tuning, chapter on ensembling, tabular chapter is pretty good, and I liked data augmentation for NLP (it's rare!). I hope this helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Book: Data analysis and machine learning for competitive data science
"I was wary of reading this book, let alone reviewing it.  I've seen a LOT of people who are so into Kaggle that they don't understand that real-world data is FAR messier, complicated, and requires a lot of work before you get to the fun of modeling. I didn't want my review to help fuel more of that thinking.Thankfully, I was wrong.This book is so much more than a cheat sheet guide to winning Kaggle competitions. It helps the reader use Kaggle as a stepping stone toward an AI/ML-related profession, such as data science or ML engineering.It starts with the history of Kaggle before it spends most of the remaining pages talking about all respects of a competition. There are chapters on organizing data; using the Kaggle notebook environment; using their discussion forums; the various tasks and metrics seen in a competition; validating, modeling, and optimizing your models; bringing together different solutions for the best results; and specific advice for both computer vision, natural language processing, and optimization tasks. The book ends with chapters on building a portfolio both within and without Kaggle as well as finding professional work.If you're interested in Kaggle or machine learning, this is a great book to get you started.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Book: Data analysis and machine learning for competitive data science

"This is the first book that I've come across that is singularly focused on the rules, format, tips, and best practices for Kaggle ML/Data Science competitions. As such, this book is well-deserving of your dollars and attention.Before even delving into specific aspects of Machine Learning, the authors chose to spend a great deal of time (chapters 1-5) outlining the basics of Kaggle competitions from the history of the platform, to teams, datasets, notebooks, discussion forums, etiquette, and the different types of competitions available on the site. Complete beginners to Kaggle would get the most use of these chapters, it sure beats trying to figure all of this stuff out on your own.The remaining chapters start getting increasingly advanced in terms of subjects and techniques. I definitely appreciate the authors discussing the importance of the design of good model validation before delving deeper into hyperparameter tuning, walk before you run!The later chapters really drill into more advanced techniques such as using hyperparameter studies and Bayesian optimization to extract the best combination of values for your specific model. Ensembling and stacking are presented as clearly as I've seen anywhere, along with the most helpful snippets of code to date on a ML book. This alone might be worth the price for some. Intermediate and advanced users will get the most of these chapters.A nice extra is the Q&A sections in each chapter with ""Kaggle Masters"", people who have either won competitions in the past or who regularly place very high in many competitions. These are done informally and provide a lot of great tips.Now, who is this book really for? If you are new to Machine Learning, I'd say that perhaps this would not be the best place to start. While the book is great for what it sets out to do (teach you to become a better competitor) it is not perfect.Some information that could be helpful to beginners is grossly glossed over, such as the explanation of specific hyperparams. It is very odd how they chose to handle this. Case-and-point: when going over XGBoost hyperparams such as ""n_estimators"", they describe it as ""usually an integer ranging from 10 to 5,000"". Compare this with Corey Wade's explanation(""Gradient Boosting with XGBoost and SciKit Learn"", also from Packt ), ""The number of trees in the ensemble/the number of trees trained on the residuals after each boosting round. Increasing might improve accuracy on larger datasets"". Which is more useful you think? You either explain it clearly for the benefit of all or just leave it out. Giving the domain and range is not a proper substitution. Obviously, the author's expect the reader to have had some exposure to algorithms and modeling as the pace of several sections move a little too quickly for the complete beginner. As such, I would say this is a perfect book for semi-intermediate to advanced users looking to extract the most out of their models.All in all, this is an excellent resource that will be sure to help countless current and aspiring data scientists in their journeys to become masters of their crafts. I wish I had access to this text five years ago...Highly Recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Book: Data analysis and machine learning for competitive data science
"Kaggle is the most famous data science competition platform. Personally I started Kaggle around 2017 and since that I have learnt a lot of machine learning techniques through participating the competitions on Kaggle. As a student at that time, the biggest challenge for students learning machine learning algorithms is there is no good way to get your hand dirty: it is very difficult to get real-world dataset and work on a real world machine learning problem. Kaggle closed this gap by introducing a data science competition hosted by industry leaders with real world dataset.However, during the process, I always get the question of how to start Kaggle from scratch from my friends or classmates who also want to join Kaggle and learn something. I really hope at that time I have a book like ""The Kaggle Book"". This book introduced how Kaggle competition looks like, and also how to use tools like dataset, notebook, forum to onboard of all the cool stuff Kaggle has. In the second part of book, it introduced some common ML and data mining technique that used by almost everyone in Kaggle. With those techniques and some experiments, it is not hard to start lock a front position on the leaderboard. In the third part, the author also introduces how we can use kaggle to find new career opportunities. As I mentioned before many people came to Kaggle without a ML career background. Kaggle provide a place for people with passions for ML to connect with people from industry and this potentially can change many people's career path.I think if you want to start doing competitions on Kaggle then this is the first book you should check. Meanwhile I also hope the author can continue to publish new books about Kaggle with more advanced techniques.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Book: Data analysis and machine learning for competitive data science
"If you are newbee and don't know where to start.

"Unless you are good at coming up with your own machine learning projects after you are done with learning the basics, it is pretty easy to get rusty unless it is part of your job. Entering Kaggle contests can keep you sharp, help you keep up with rapidly changing techniques, and learn by doing.And this book will show you how to compete at Kaggle. The first chapter tells you what Kaggle is all about, so you don't get lost on the platform. The second and third chapters show you how to organize your data for Kaggle and use Kaggle notebooks to build and run your algorithms. If you need more information, chapter 4 is all about the Kaggle forums and how you can find help there. Chapter 5 is all about the target metrics, so you can fine tune your entries to get the highest score.The next 7 chapters go through the machine learning techniques you might use during a Kaggle competition. While this part of the book is good as a refresher for beginning Kaggle contestants, it helps to know some machine learning before getting this book because some beginner concepts are glossed over. But it is a great second book after you know the basics, especially for honing and testing your skills. To teach it all, this book would have to be ridiculously huge.Finally, the last two chapters show you how to make your Kaggle competition entries do double duty and help you find a job. Chapter 13 shows you how to build a portfolio with your entries and Chapter 14 teaches you about networking with other data professionals and finding a job in the industry.I recommend this book if you are new to Kaggle.

"This book is great at generating enthusiasm for online competitions, in particular Kaggle.  In the Forward, the Founder and CEO of Kaggle describes Kaggle as a place to learn what developments matter on real-world problems (given that no one can read the 300 new ML papers published each day), to learn new tools, to learn by doing, to increase ML fitness, and to have a chance to try a problem and later see how the winners did it.The book includes many text boxes containing an interview with an experienced Kaggler, a Master or Grandmaster.  I find these very interesting.  Questions include “What advice would you give for how to start a competition?”, “How do you approach a competition?”, “What mistakes have you made?”, “How does a competition compare with your daily data science work?”, “What tools do you recommend?”, “What has been your favorite competition?”, etc.The first 4 chapters are solid and “introductory” describing how Kaggle works, mentions other competitions, Kaggle datasets, working with Kaggle notebooks (a nice non-local approach to computing), and leveraging discussion forums.  The next 8 chapters are technical.  They describe evaluation metrics, strongly emphasize the importance of designing a good validation strategy to protect your models against over- or under-fitting on the private test data, EDA to develop intuition and to find hidden groups, T-SNE and UMAP for summarizing an entire dataset at a glance, hyperparameter optimization, ensembling multiple solutions, augmentations for computer vision and NLP problems, and a new kind of contest focusing on simulation and optimization which involves a broader range of methods and a higher mathematical content.  The last two chapters focus on creating a portfolio of projects and ideas and on finding new professional opportunities.The book has a GitHub site where you can get the code and a Discord space, where the authors offer an “Ask Me Anything” session monthly.The book serves as a very useful reference for hard to find tips and tricks, and provides suggestions to “allow anyone to reach the Expert level”.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Kaggle Book: Data analysis and machine learning for competitive data science

"Reviewers who dismiss this book as too elementary should have read the excerpts in the listing: the author addresses this situation. There are parts that are already familiar to me, but considering them as parts of a well-defined process puts them in a new perspective.To the reviewer who dismisses it by saying that all of the information is available on the web, I say ""Yes, and I've collected tons of it; the problem is similar to the problea facing a data scientist:  diverse data sets that ovelap -- but in ways that make it extraordinarily difficult and time consuming to align them usefully."" Having it all presented in the context of a logical, coherent process is like having a real meal, not just scraping together whatever leftovers happen to be in the fridge today.I shopped around a lot before settling on Godsey's book, and at the halfway point I'm still thoroughly convinced that I chose wisely.The principal difference between TLADS and every other book I evaluated is that Godsey's emphasis is on PROCESS rather than tools and methods. He addresses the latter, but this is not Yet Another Book About How To Do Data Science With { R | Python }: there are plenty of those out there, and I've picked the ones I uant to use -- but AFTER I've learned about the art and craft of the discipline of data science. To me, it makes little sense to learn how to use woodworking tools before learning about how to make furniture (or frame a house, or...). That's one of Godsey's analogies, BTW.Godsey is a very good writer -- not always true of technical authors -- and an excellent teacher. He knows how to express the technical content in a manner that's approachable but not condescending: Data Science For Dummies this is emphatically NOT. And because I've been working for 30 years in an area of AI that requires some of the same skills as data science, I know from personal experience that the techniques and processes Godsey elaborates on are dead-on accurate, and just as critical to the data gathering and ""munging"" process as he says they are.If you're looking for a book on doing data science from a hands-on, technical POV, you can choose from the many books that focus on this.If you want to understand how to pursue a career in data science in the real world -- how to BE a data scientist -- look no further.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Think Like a Data Scientist: Tackle the data science process step--step
"This book really puts into perspective the stages of projects in data science, how they fit together, how you go from one to the next, and what are the important questions to ask at each phase. Insightful and thorough, beginning of a data science project through to the end.One thing that this book seems to do that others don't is really get to the ""why"" of doing things in data science. It's doesn't just say ""let's apply this machine learning program"" but actually discusses the possibilities, with strengths and weaknesses, and essentially let's the reader decide what to do, with lots of guidance. It feels very deliberate and careful, which I thought was good.Other reviewers are right, though, that it doesn't cover much advanced technical stuff, so if you're looking for that, this book isn't for you. I think that wasn't the point of this book, though. It's more about how to think about data and using it to solve problems and achieve goals through a process.I like the writing style. It's a little like stream-of-consciousness thoughts maybe could be organized better, but it really gives the feeling that you know what a data scientist should be thinking. It's actually kind of fun to read, at least compared to other software books. I do disagree with one reviewer's comment that this book doesn't contain much new information. I couldn't find most of the contents elsewhere, which is why I bought the book. Now I feel way more competent talking to my data science colleagues about what they're doing, and I'm probably a better manager, too, since I understand more about it now.Overall, good book about process, goals, concepts, thought process, priorities, and not so much about how to do complex software development. Probably good for beginners, non-technical folks, as well as people who know how to write some code but don't really know where to start with data and data science (like me).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Think Like a Data Scientist: Tackle the data science process step--step
"I felt that the book lacked depth and it was just a collection of freely available material if one were to google on how to become data scientist. The book sort of organized the context for someone not to be all over the place and walked the reader starting out in the field of DS, but for someone who already has some experience in DS field this book would be too basic, so feel free to skip it.Many examples that were given in the book (enron dataset, etc) are good examples and the ones that are generally used, but I wanted to see something new. So once again, I feel that this book is a collection of material that can be obtained freely off the web, all it did was to put it in one place for you to read.

"Kleppmann mentioned during his ""Turning the Database Inside Out with Apache Samza"" talk at Strange Loop 2014 (see my notes) that he was on sabbatical working on this book, and while waiting quite some time for it to be published, I ended up experimenting with his Bottled Water project as well as Apache Kafka (which was only at release 0.8.2.2 at that point in time). Other reviewers are correct that much of the material included in this book is available elsewhere, but this book is packaged well (although still at 550-pages and heavyweight), with most of the key topics associated with data-intensive applications under one roof with good explanations and numerous footnotes which point to resources providing additional detail.Content is broken down into 3 sections and 12 chapters: (1) foundations of data systems, which covers reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications, data models and query languages, storage and retrieval, and encoding and evolution, (2) distributed data, which covers replication, partitioning, transactions, the trouble with distributed systems, and consistency and consensus, and (3) derived data, which covers batch processing, stream processing, and the future of data systems. The latter 6 chapters are weighted more heavily, with chapter 9 on consistency and consensus, and chapter 12 on the future of data systems, the most lengthy with each comprising about 12% of the book.Some potential readers might be disappointed that this book is all theory, but while the author does not provide any code he discusses practical implementation and specific details when applicable for comparisons within a product category. In my opinion, the last chapter is probably the most abstract simply because it explores ideas about how the tools covered in the prior two chapters might be used in the future to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications. Similiary, the chapter on the opposite end of this book sets the stage well for any developer of nontrivial applications with its section on thinking about database systems and the concerns around reliability, scalability, and maintainability.About a year ago, I recall an executive colleague responding to me with a quizzical look when I mentioned that tooling for data and application development is converging over time, and just a few months prior I mentioned in a presentation to developers that transactional and analytical capabilities are being provided more and more by single database products, with one executive in the audience shaking his head in disagreement that kappa rather than lambda architectures are the way to go. Kleppman mentions that we typically think of databases, message brokers, caches, etc as residing in very different categories of tooling because each of these has very different access patterns, meaning different performance characteristics and therefore different implementations.So why should all of this tooling not be lumped together under an umbrella term such as 'data systems'? Many products for data storage and processing have emerged in recent years, optimized for a variety of use cases and no longer neatly fitting into traditional categories: the boundaries between categories are simply becoming blurred, and since a single tool can no longer satisfy the data processing and storage needs for many applications, work is broken down into tasks that can be performed efficiently on a single system that is often comprised of different tooling stitched together by application code under the covers.In addition to the author's abundant and effective simple line diagrams that are reminiscent (although more sophisticated) of his earlier diagrams, one aspect that I especially appreciate is the nomenclature comparisons between products when walking through terminology. For example, at the beginning of chapter 6, the author specifically calls out the terminological confusion that exists with respect to partitioning. ""What we call a 'partition' here is called a 'shard' in MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and SolrCloud; it's known as a 'region' in HBase, a 'tablet' in Bigtable, a 'vnode' in Cassandra and Riak, and a 'vBucket' in Couchbase. However, partitioning is the most established term, so we'll stick to that.""In addition, Kleppmann walks through differences between products when the same terminology is being used, which can also lead to confusion. For example, in chapter 7 the author provides a great 5-page discussion on the meaning of ""ACID"" (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability), which was an effective reminder to me that while this term was coined in 1983 in an effort to establish precise terminology for fault-tolerance mechanisms in databases, in practice one database's implementation of ACID does not equal another's implementation. ""Today, when a system claims to be 'ACID compliant', it's unclear what guarantees you can actually expect. ACID has unfortunately become mostly a marketing term.""If you've ever found yourself confused about the concept of ""consistency"", the author offers a sanity check that your confusion is warranted, not only because the term is ""terribly overloaded"" with at least four different meanings, but because ""the letter C doesn't really belong in ACID"" since it was ""tossed in to make the acronym work"" in the original paper, and that ""it wasn't considered important at the time."" The reality is that ""atomicity, isolation, and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency (in the ACID sense) is a property of the application. The application may rely on the database's atomicity and isolation properties in order to achieve consistency, but it's not up to the database alone.""An later in chapter 9 where he discusses consistency and consensus, the author provides a great sidebar on ""the unhelpful CAP theorem"". As Kleppmann later comments, ""the CAP theorem as formally defined is of very narrow scope: it only considers one consistency model (namely linearizability) and one kind of fault (network partitions, or nodes that are alive but disconnected from each other). It doesn't say anything about network delays, dead nodes, or other trade-offs. Thus, although CAP has been historically influential, it has little practical value for designing systems.""The author concludes in a sidebar by commenting that ""all in all, there is a lot of misunderstanding and confusion around CAP, and it does not help us understand systems better, so CAP is best avoided."" This is because ""CAP is sometimes presented as 'Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance: pick 2 out of 3'. Unfortunately, putting it this way is misleading because network partitions are a kind of fault, so they aren't something about which you have a choice: they will happen whether you like it or not...A better way of phrasing CAP would be 'either Consistent or Available when Partitioned'. A more reliable network needs to make this choice less often, but at some point the choice is inevitable.""While the second section of this text on distributed data was most beneficial to me, the third section on derived data was least beneficial, mainly because I'm already familiar with these topics from recent readings and experience, and because I needed to refamiliarize myself with the content discussed in the second section. However, the author presents derived data well, and I certainly do not recommend skipping this section. As Kleppmann comments, the issues around integrating multiple different data systems into one coherent application architecture is often overlooked by vendors who claim that their product can satisfy all of your needs. In reality, integrating disparate systems (which can be grouped into the two broad categories of ""systems of record"" and ""derived data systems"") is one of the most important things that needs to be done in a nontrivial application. I highly recommend this text.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable Scalable and Maintainable Systems
"Designing Data-Intensive Applications really exceeded my expectations. Even if you are experienced in this area this book will re-enforce things you know (or sort of know) and bring to light new ways of thinking about solving distributed systems and data problems. It will give you a solid understanding of how to choose the right tech for different use cases.The book really pulls you in with an intro that is more high level, but mentions problems and solutions that really anyone who has worked on these types of applications have either encountered or heard mention of. The promise it makes is to take these issues such as scalability, maintainability and durability and explain how to decide on the right solutions to these issues for the problems you are solving. It does an amazing job of that throughout the book.This book covers a lot, but at the same time it knows exactly when to go deep on a subject. Right when it seems like it may be going too deep on things like how different types of databases are implemented (SSTables, B-trees, etc.) or on comparing different consensus algorithms, it is quick to point out how and why those things are important to practical real-world problems and how understanding those things is actually vital to the success of a system.Along those same lines it is excellent at circling back to concepts introduced at prior points in the book. For example the book goes into how log based storage is used for some databases as their core way of storing data and for durability in other cases. Later in the book when getting into different message/eventing systems such as Kafka and ActiveMQ things swing back to how these systems utilize log based storage in similar ways. Even if you have prior knowledge or even have worked with these technologies, how and why they work and the pros and cons of each become crystal clear and really solidified. Same can be said of it's great explanations of things like ZooKeeper and why specific solutions like Kafka make use of it.This book is also amazing at shedding light on the fact that so little of what is out there is totally new, it attempts to go back as far as it can at times on where a certain technology's ideas originated (back to the 1800s at some points!). Bringing in this history really gives a lot of context around the original problems that were being solved, which in turn helps understanding pros and cons. One example is the way it goes through the history of batch processing systems and HDFS. The author starts with MapReduce and relating it to tech that was developed decades before. This really clarifies how we got from batch processing systems on proprietary hardware to things like MapReduce on commodity hardware thanks in part to HDFS, eventually to stream based processing. It also does great at explaining the pros and cons of each and when one might choose one technology over the other.That's really the theme of this book, teaching the reader how to compare and contrast different technologies for solving distributed systems and data problems. It teaches you to read between the lines on how certain technologies work so that you can identify the pros and cons early and without needing them to be spelled out by the authors of those technologies. When thinking about databases it teaches you to really consider the durability/scalability model and how things are no where near black and white between ""consistent"" vs ""eventually consistent"", these is a ton of nuance there and it goes deep on things like single vs multi leader vs leaderless, linearizability, total order broadcast, and different consensus algorithms.I could go on forever about this book. To name a few other things it touches on to get a good idea of the breadth here: networking (and networking faults), OLAP, OLTP, 2 phase locking, graph databases, 2 phase commit, data encoding, general fault tolerance, compatibility, message passing, everything I mentioned above, and the list goes on and on and on. I recommend anyone who does any kind of work with these systems takes the time to read this book. All 600ish pages are worth reading, and it's presented in an excellent, engaging way with real world practical examples for everything.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable Scalable and Maintainable Systems

"It is really hard to overstate how comprehensively this book covers nearly everything that is currently known about building large, scalable, high performance, data centric applications. If every Kafka queueing, Cassandra clustering, Redis loving, Kinesis slinging, Map reducing, CAP theorem quoting systems engineer read this book, the world would actually be a better place. It really is that good.The front pages contain a quote from Alan Kay that I will summarize as ""most people who write code for money ... have no idea where [their culture came from]."" This book will learn you some of the culture you are missing! Every developer writing modern Internet facing application software, particularly in cloud computing environments, will run into the problems described here. Far too many of these developers will pick up a grab bag of half baked solutions from reading various Stack Overflow posts, blogs from better informed writers, and from hyped up claims made by the currently trendy ""technologies.""  Many of these sources will obscure the fundamental nature of the underlying problems, and will lead said developers to overly naive designs, and provide a false sense of security. Such systems will even work pretty nicely for a while, but they will usually fail spectacularly when they are actually presented with component failures or high system load (or both at the same time, which is quite typical).This book talks about the underlying structure of the problems we all face when building contemporary distributed applications. It ties together all the foundational aspects of both distributed computing and data storage in a chorent manner. It teaches you how to think about the problem space by demonstrating where many popular and widely used software products fit. You're not going to learn about any one single product. Instead you will learn what you must know to evaluate as many of them as you want, learn which interactions between different components matter, and then make informed choices for your own design.This is not an academic text book, it is a working professional's guide to the field. It has all the references to the classic papers and textbooks that form the formal foundations of the subject, But it is so clearly written, and accessible, that you could go a very long way without needing to read any of them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable Scalable and Maintainable Systems
"Imagine that your coding project is like being stuck on a battlefield at night, trying to cut your way through a maze of barbed wire.  The average software book is like a flashlight: it illuminates the immediate problem and helps you figure out how to solve it.  This book, in contrast, is like a flare shot high into the air.  For a brief few moments, it illuminates the entire battlefield, and you can see your lines behind you, the positions of the enemy trenches and fortifications, and even roads, fields and forest in the distance.  You're still going to need the flashlight for getting the job done, but getting perspective is invaluable for figuring out where you are and where you're going.If all you want to know is the minimum needed to do your job _today_, you probably won't like this book, because it covers too much territory to teach you the details of how to do any one thing.  However if you want to understand how your current objective fits into the bigger landscape (and why), this book is one of the best overviews I've ever read, for any discipline.  Kleppmann has a deep knowledge of the fundamentals and he writes in lucid, simple prose so that anyone can understand the concepts.  There's a surprising amount of nitty-gritty detail about things like replication and sharding in distributed databases, and once you grasp the concepts, you'll be well-equipped to judge for yourself how any system fits your needs.Much of what one reads online about database software has the flavor of commercial advertising or semi-religous feuding among disciples of one system or another.  So for me it was a real gift to have Kleppmann explain how technical details distingish data systems from each other, why the system designers made those choices, and what strengths and weaknesses result from them.  I highly recommend the book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable Scalable and Maintainable Systems

"Disclaimer: I served as a paid technical editor for Data Smart. I am not affiliated with the publisher, but I did receive a small fee for double-checking the book's mathematical content before it went to press. I also went to elementary school with the author. So as you read the rest of the review, keep in mind that this reviewer's judgment could be clouded by my lifelong allegiance to Lookout Mountain Elementary School, as well as the Scarface-esque pile of one dollar bills currently sitting on my kitchen table.Anyway, books about ""Data"" seem to fit into one of the following categories:* Extremely technical gradate-level mathematics books with lots of Greek letters and summation signs* Pie-in-the-sky business bestsellers about how ""Data"" is going to revolutionize the world as we know it. (I call these ""Moneyball"" books)* Technical books about the hottest new ""Big Data"" technology such as R and HadoopData Smart is none of these. Unlike ""Moneyball"" books, Data Smart contains enough practical information to actually start performing analyses. Unlike most textbooks, it doesn't get bogged down in mathematical notation. And unlike books about R or the distributed data blah-blah du jour, all the examples use good old Microsoft Excel. It's geared toward competent analysts who are comfortable with Excel and aren't afraid of thinking about problems in a mathematical way. It's goal isn't to ""revolutionize"" your business with million-dollar software, but rather to make incremental improvements to processes with accessible analytic techniques.I don't work at a big company, so I can't attest to the number of dollars your company will save by applying the book's methods. But I can attest that the author makes difficult mathematical concepts accessible with his quirky sense of humor and gift for metaphor. For example, I previously had not been exposed to the nitty-gritty of clustering techniques. After a couple of hours with the clustering chapters, which include illuminating diagrams and spreadsheet formulas, I felt like I had a good handle on the concepts, and would feel comfortable implementing the ideas in Excel -- or any other language, for that matter.What I like most about the book is that it doesn't try to wave a magic data wand to cure all of your company's ills. Instead it focuses on a few areas where data and analytic techniques can deliver a concrete benefit, and gives you just enough to get started. In particular:* Optimization techniques (Ch. 4) can systematically reduce the cost of manufacturing inputs* Clustering techniques (Ch. 2 and 5) can deliver insights into customer behavior* Predictive techniques (Ch. 3, 6, and 7) can increase margins with better predictions of uncertain outcomes* Forecasting techniques (Ch. 8) can reduce waste with better demand planningIt may take some creativity to figure out how to apply the methods to your own business processes, but all of the techniques are ""tried and true"" in the sense of being widely deployed at large companies with big analytics budgets and teams of Ph.D.'s on staff. This book's contribution is to make these techniques available to anyone with a little background in applied mathematics and a copy of Excel. For that reason, despite the absence of glitter and/or Jack Welch on the book's cover, I think Data Smart is an important business book.I had a few criticisms of the book as I was reading drafts, but almost all of them were addressed before the final revision. For the sake of completeness, I'll tell you what they were. Some of the chapters ran on a bit long, but these have been split up into manageable pieces. The Optimization chapter is a bit of a doozie, and used to be at the very beginning, but the reader can now ""warm up"" with some easier chapters on clustering and simple Bayesian techniques. The Regression chapter originally didn't discuss Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, which are important for evaluating predictive models visually, but now ROC curves are abundant.Only one real criticism from me remains: I would have liked to see more on quantile regression, which is only mentioned in passing. It's a great technique for dealing with outlier-heavy data. The book by Koenker has good but highly mathematical coverage, and I would have loved to see this subject given the Foreman treatment. But, you can't have everything, and I suppose John needs to leave some material for Data Smart 2: The Spreadsheet of Doom.In sum, Data Smart is a well-written and engaging guide to getting new insights from data using familiar tools. The techniques aren't really cutting-edge -- in fact, most have been around for decades -- but to my knowledge this is the first time they've been presented in a way that Excel-slinging business analysts can apply the methods without needing her own team of operations researchers and data scientists. If you're not sure whether the book's sophistication is on par with your own skills, you can download a complete sample chapter (as well as example spreadsheets) from the author's website.One last thing: unlike many books with a technical bent, the prose is engaging and extremely clear. I think this can be traced to John's childhood. When John misbehaved, his father (who is a professor of English) would punish John by forcing him to read a novel by Charles Dickens. Minor infractions resulted in A Christmas Carol being meted out, and when he was really bad he had to read Great Expectations. This is a true story which you should ask John about if you see him at a book-signing event.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight
"I highly recommend John Foreman's book: 'Data Smart - Using Data Science to Transform Data into Insight'. The author's approach is unique - he teaches data science skills without teaching programming. His approach works because he limits the newness of each subject item to one dimension, that being the data science technique at hand. Each skill is introduced in the familiar environment of Excel and its spreadsheets. If the author had introduced a programming language at the same time, the difficulty of staying focused on the technique being taught would have been increased greatly.Each technique introduced is explained by first posing and then working through a business problem. Each problem has an accompanying Excel dataset. For each challenge, you are soon immersed in data - your Excel skills will be stretched and improved and you will need to work hard to keep abreast of each lesson. It is worthwhile for the reader because tangible learning occurs as the data is worked through and the business challenges are demonstrably solved.The techniques you will learn include:Cluster analysis using k-means and k-medians algorithmsDocument classification using a Naive Bayes algorithmOptimization modeling using linear programming methodsCommunity detection in network graphs using modularity maximizationLinear and logistic regressionEnsemble models based on bagging and boosting techniquesForecasting based on exponential smoothing with trend and seasonality (ETS)Outlier detection using k-nearest-neighbors and local outlier factorsIn addition to teaching techniques, the author sprinkles the text with conclusions he has formed based on his years of data science practice and on a healthy skepticism for some of the overblown claims made for data science. His advice includes the following:Beware the poorly posed problem. Data scientists must learn to communicate with stakeholders in order to help frame business problems properly.You will generally get more benefit by spending time selecting good data and engineering better data features than searching for a marginally better predictive model. A great model cannot deliver good performance with poor data.Remember, industry is not academia. In industry, analytics is a results-driven pursuit. The best model is the one that strikes a balance between performance and usability. If a model is never used, it is worthless.Mailchimp, the author's employer, has TB of data under management. However, it neither needs nor uses all this data for analysis and model training. Instead it aggregates its data to the level the business requires. This aggregate dataset is typically 10GB in size. This aggregation enables mailchimp to use R in production.Data science is not the most important function in the organization. The purpose of the data science function is to serve the business and help it achieve its goals. The purpose of data science is not to build models for their own sake.The author introduces the R programming language in the final chapter, as a gateway to doing further work in data science. R is very powerful but it can appear to be a black-box tool for solving data analysis problems. As the author explains, R has great performance but it is not great for explaining the inner workings of models.At the outset, the author explained that he preferred clarity over mathematical correctness when writing the book. He did an excellent job. The aspiring data scientist will learn by doing in the familiar and manageable environment of Excel.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight

"I would go as far as to say that the book is brilliant.First, a drop about me from the standpoint of this book. I have been an IT professional for many years specializing in programming, database, and MS Office add-ons. Part of my job entails self enrichment, that is, expand my working knowledge in areas potentially important for my job. I chose Foreman's book to help with this task for a number of reasons: a) Data Science is a hot area and my company does have a Data Science group, b) I have lots of data experience under my belt - I felt that it would be nice for once to get some useful information from the data, and c) I have a really good Excel background - so I figured that Foreman's approach would be perfect for me - little did I know that I would seriously add to my Excel bag of tricks.The author makes the assumptions that: a) the reader is somewhat technical, b) he knows nothing about Data Science, and c) he is relatively comfortable working in Excel.Reading the book is a joy because Foreman has a cozy, chummy style. He definitely doesn't throw all the technical stuff at the reader rat-tat-tat machine gun style like many other authors. Instead, Foreman gently introduces his topics and then ramps up technical details carefully. This most definitely helps the learning process.Speaking of learning, by the end of the you will have learned important concepts in ""machine learning"" and I believe that you will be ready for the next step. I sure was. I found the topics interesting and I wanted to learn more. This is where the book's only problem area comes into play - the next step. Foreman has 3 references - one good, but minor, one terrible, and the other is inappropriate. Let me explain.Foreman recommends a free resource as a follow-on to his Forecasting Chapter. This is a good reference, but I believe that Forecasting is a minor topic in Data Science, unless, of course, Forecasting becomes your thing.Foreman's main reference is: ""Data Mining with R"" by Luis Torgo. Foreman recommends this as the next step after his book.I tried to read this several times, but couldn't. It certainly wasn't my next step.The other reference, ""The Elements of Statistical Learning"" by Trevor Hastie, et. al, is totally inappropriate for Data Science newbies. You can checkout the Amazon reviews for this book and you'll see that you need a pretty serious background in statistics to get anything out of that reference. In fact, the author Hastie says as much in his next book ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning- with Applications in R"". This is the appropriate next step, but I'll get to that in a moment.Here are my recommendations:A. Read Foreman's book and follow along with him in working through the Excel spreadsheets. This is a first step in getting comfortable with Machine Learning.B. Take the Coursera courses: 1) Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach, and 2) Machine Learning: Regression. The courses are free unless you want completion certificates, in which case there is nominal cost.C. Now you are ready for:

"This is an excellent book and incredibly powerful if you're in any sort of field that requires data analysis. I've read many books on the subject of statistical analysis and most seem to fall in the category of:1.) A very technical ""how-to"" on using Excel/R/whatever to run certain functions but there is a huge assumption that you understand what the data output means. These are more like user manuals for their respective programs.2.) A more high-level view of stats that is similar to stuff you learned in Statistics 101 but with far less examples and it can be difficult to see how this will apply in your position.Foreman's book was recommended to me by Chandoo of Excel Guru fame and it is the book I've been searching for to step up my game. He does a great job of breaking down core concepts and introducing new tools(all in Excel!) that I can actually apply to my current position. That being said, there are a couple of caveats...1.) I would recommend at least 6 months of solid Excel usage under your belt. The author goes over the formulas and you can download the files online, however there is plenty of OFFSET and Array formulas that can be intimidating to more casual users. I highly recommend downloading the files and doing everything from scratch, and then using the author's version as reference when you get stuck.2.) This is not really a book you can breeze through(and I mean this as a compliment). The core concepts are broken down well but you will need to reread chapters to truly understand how the formulas and underlying concepts fit. I personally read Chapter 2 around 5-6 times so I can grasp k-means clustering and how I can apply it to my current project. I've only been in the data analysis world for a couple of years, so perhaps this is just my noviceness showing.This is a fantastic book and one I cannot recommend enough. I hope that Foreman continues to expand on this series as I really enjoy his writing style and his ability to confer what's truly important in data science.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight
"If you want to get started with Data Science and don’t like learning a new language such as R or Python, then this book is a perfect fit for you. Entertaining, Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight approaches data science from a unusual angle. John W. Foreman has written a book for those who wants to apply data mining without using advanced programming (R, Python, etc.). It doesn’t mean you don’t need to understand what data science is, and this book is very good at explaining it to non-practitioners.Foreman’s book is written in a nice and funny stile, which makes it an easy read. Data mining algorithms are described with the minimum equations needed. Foreman has written a practical book and thus decided to use Excel as a tool for data science. The book starts with an introduction to Excel and its most famous functions. For data scientists using SAS, R, Python or Matlab, you may discover how powerful Excel is. But you will also see how clumsy it is to use Excel for data science. Whereas you would need a few lines in R, the book will take you through a dozen pages of step by step actions you need to perform to obtain the same in Excel. Not only is it more time consuming but also more prone to errors.Don’t get me wrong: Data Smart is excellent at explaining how to perform data science in Excel. I just think Excel is not the right tool for it. The book is also a journey into MailChimp, the author’s company. This is nice and provides plenty of examples related to e-mail marketing. The book thus provides quick and high-level description of the problem, followed by Excel steps to solve it. In conclusion, Data Smart is a must read to get a fresh perspective on data science with a “Data Science using Excel” user manual. And for the experts? You can just skip the Excel parts and get insights into the field, with a focus on MailChimp use cases.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight

"The best single book on Data Science today. I handle the data analysis and BI for the delivery side of a huge internet-based retail company, and have been a fan of Foreman's since his ""Analytics Made Skeezy"" blog days.  His explanations are clear, his examples are to the point, and throughout it all, he is results-oriented. That is an important distinction; if you want theory, if you want to follow the development of algorithms, then attend a lecture by Moses Charikar (actually everyone should attend a Charikar lecture, just for the utter joy of the intellectual insights.) If you want a hands-on, practical guide to the processes involved in Data Science, then Foreman is your guy. Unlike many writers in the field, he is not an ""every problem is a nail"" guru, touting one magic approach to all problems. Neither is he a database guy or business stats guy who recently found it sexier and more lucrative to describe himself as a data scientist.

It was until recently ago that I discovered I really do love numbers and specifically statistics.  It’s around this all the time whether through social media or my favorite thing, gaming.  Looking back, I think educators were not ever explaining to me in a way that grabbed my attention that made me want to further my math education.  The blame can’t lie solely on the educators I grew up with, so I recently took it into my own hands to further my own understanding of math.I stumbled across the audio book Naked Statistics by Charles Wheelan, a professor at Dartmouth college.  I found the narration to the enticing and upon finishing the audio book actually bought the physical copy and marked it up heavily with notes of my own.Throughout the book the author gives great detail about how statistics can truly improve our lives while the same time helping readers understand the power that comes with it and how the power can be used and negative ways as well.Now there are a few key points I want to highlight about the book:Statistics rarely offer a single “right” way of doing anythingStatistics can be powerful for establishing an argumentHoweverStatistics can also be very easy to misuseThe book opens with an explanation of the classic Monty Hall problem, which is a brain teaser in the form of a probability puzzle loosely based on the 1980’s television show “Let’s Make a Deal”.  I’d never quite comprehend it the full detail of this problem until this book.  I encourage you to look into unknown because not only to find to be interesting but also provided a great starting point for understanding for help powerful statistics can truly be.Uses of StatisticsDescription and comparisonInferenceAssessing risk and probabilityIdentifying important relationships (correlation)Descriptive Statistics“Who was the best baseball player of all time?”Descriptive statistics can be technically accurate yet pretty misleading.  The author explains that “The good news is that these descriptive statistics gives us a manageable and meaningful summary of the underlying phenomenon,” and continues with “the bad news is that any simplification invites abuse.”Wheelan highlights the Gini Index, which is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income distribution of the nation’s residents and most commonly used to measure inequality.  The problem however is that this is a mere useless stat.  It simply takes the per capita income of a nation and divides it by the number of people.  But who was actually earning how much of that income?  That is the key missing piece.Precision vs AccuracyThe author goes on to describe the differences between precision and accuracy.Precision: “The exactitude with which we can express something”Accuracy: “Measure of whether a figure is broadly consistent with the truth”Correlation“Measures the degree to which two phenomena are related to one another.Correlation coefficient: Expressed on a scale of -1 -> 11: every change in one variable is associated with an equivalent change in the other variable in the same direction-1: every change in one variable is associated with an equivalent change in the other variable in the opposite directionProbability:“Study of events in outcomes including elements of uncertainty.”There were a few key takeaways from this chapter:Don’t play Lotto (Pg. 80)You should invest in the stock market if you have a long-term investment horizon (because stocks typically have the best long-term returns)Probability is not deterministicThere are several problems with probability, however.  The 2008 Wall Street crash and financial crisis largely had to do with computers misusing probability. The VaR model, or Value at Risk, which was called “potentially catastrophic”.  Value at risk is a measure of risk in investments, and estimates how much a set of investments might lose given normal market conditions and a set time period, such as any day.  This model offered 99% reassurance about 1% is the difference between success and failure.The importance of data (Garbage in and out)When working with numbers you assume that you retrieve and good data, but no amount of fancy analysis can make up for fundamentally flawed data.Selection bias: “How have you chosen the samples you are evaluating?”Self-selection bias: “Will arise whenever individuals volunteer to be any treatment group.”Publication bias: “positive findings are more likely to be published”This distorts the research that we see, or more evidently, do not see.  This pious comes from not directly his studies themselves but from the skewed information that reaches the public.  Typically, medical journals now require that any study be registered at the beginning of the project to help combat this problem of only publishing information that researchers want to see.Inference“The process by which data speaks to us enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions.” The typical tool that researchers will use is a hypothesis, which is a proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.While statistical inference offers many benefits it also comes with some significant pitfalls.  Notably, statistical inference is based on a probability, And not some sort of absolute certainty.PollingThe power polling comes also comes from the central limit theorem, similar to other forms of sampling. Where it differs however, is that we don’t care about the mean, but we actually care about the percentage, or proportion relative to our results. But again, this can be powerful for example the poll of 1000 individuals can offer meaningful insight into the attitudes of an entire nation.Regression Analysis“Allows us to quantify the relationship between a particular variable and how come we care about, while controlling for other factors.” It’s important to note there are many pitfalls of regression analysis, and is the hydrogen bomb of the statistical arsenal! Most of the studies that you read about in the newspaper are based on regression analysis.Bringing it all togetherNow that you’re more informed, consider these aspects of statistics the next time you stumble across an infographic on social media which illustrates only one point, or discover an article which takes a stand on a topic. I never realized how large of a role statistics plays in my life, but the author’s enthusiasm and clear instruction helped me to not only appreciate it, but has also further sparked my interest.If you have other books you’d like to recommend regarding math, business, or computer science, I’d love to hear about them.Key Takeaways:Statistics rarely offer a single “right” way of doing anythingStatistics can be powerful for establishing an argumentHoweverStatistics can also be very easy to misuse",5.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"For lay people interested in better understand the world of data and statistics, this book and Tim Harford's ""The Data Dectective"" are the two books I most highly recommend.I first read this while in undergrad. Now with a few years of professional work, and a nearly completed grad program, I decided to re-read Naked Statistics. This book was one of the things that sparked my interest in statistics and data in undergrad. Now with more experience and expertise, I realize just how thorough yet succinct the text is. Wheelan writes in a very informal way that I think is approachable for a wide audience. It's certainly not a dry read like all my beloved textbooks. I particularly love how he focuses on intuition and non-technical explanations first then dives into more nitty-gritty details after he's shown how non-intimidating and intuitive the statistical idea really is. I think this approach will prevent readers from getting turned off when the mathematical details are explained (though those are also simplified significantly for lay readers).I plan on teaching data and statistics soon at my local technical college, and will use this book as my outline for an intro to stats class and make it required reading. The combination of detail and approachable content is perfect to educate without turning students off the subject. Of course more advanced texts are needed to learn how to practice statistics in the real world, but this is a good addition to those more rigorous texts.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data

"Statistics of never been my stronger skills, but the book break it down into layman terms, so I will continue to use this booking reference it",4.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"This book serves such an incredibly important purpose in that it really explains the fundamentals of statistics in a way that can be appreciated and understood by the vast majority of reasonably educated laymen.Of course, that in itself begs the question:  so what?  What about statistics is so ""important"" that the average person should take notice?  Well, for a lot of reasons that Mr. Wheelan explains so well its hard to add anything to it, but I'll give one brief attempt for those of you bothering to read the review:  At its core, statistics is about organizing data in a meaningful way such that we can draw accurate conclusions about our environment...in other words, statistics can help us make sense of the world around us in a very meaningful and practical way.  Statistics is really just a mathematically formalized form of what our brains do intuitively, and without that core concept of filtering and making sense of the information we're exposed to we would all be paralyzed - unable to make associations, draw conclusions, or derive any meaning from our environment.  Learning would be impossible, life would be meaningless, and existence and survival itself would be impossible.  Statistics takes that core function and focuses it in very particular ways, which if done correctly, can yield amazing results that add worthwhile knowledge and positivity to life.  To quote the book, ""Statistics is the most powerful tool we have for using information to some meaningful end.""Further, if that description doesn't at least somewhat tempt you how about this:  Even if you don't care about statistics, those that have enormous influence on your life and happiness  (e.g. businesses, politicians, government organizations, media, and everybody else that has a vested interested in influencing your mindset, perspectives, and behaviors) very much care about statistics and use them, for both good and ill, to ""help"" you see and do things a certain way.  Knowledge of statistics can help transform you from ""propagandized"" to ""informed"".  This is one of my favorite aspects of the book, that is, the author acknowledges and recognizes the danger of inappropriately used statistics; he even conceived the book as an homage to 
How to Lie with Statistics: 1st (First) Edition
, and as he very correctly points out right in the introduction of the book, ""Statistics is like a high-caliber weapon:  helpful when used correctly and potentially disastrous in the wrong hands.""Amazingly, this book is a fun and enjoyable read.  No seriously.  Mr. Wheelan exposes himself as a fantastic teacher, bringing an enthusiasm and energy to the subject coupled with a gift of explaining ideas and concepts in a way that most (not just ""stat people"") can understand and appreciate.Although this isn't a ""textbook"" per se, I think it remains relevant for the whole spectrum of people from total ""newbies"" all the way to hard-core statistics researchers.  Why?  Fundamentals.  The author explains the fundamentals in a clear concise way using practical, relevant, and familiar examples from our everyday lives.  For those new to the subject you'll get an ""intro to statistics"" class from a very gifted Ivy-league professor that will give you a solid well-rooted realistic foundation that you can both apply to your everyday life as well as prepare you for higher level statistics courses if you so choose.  For those already well-versed in statistics or professionals, it will reacquaint you with why what you do matters as well as provide you a wonderful way to explain to others why what you do matters.  Personally, I'm somewhere in the middle in that I've had a reasonably high level statistics background (relative to the average college graduate, anyway) and as I read the book I kept thinking to myself, ""Man, if only I had had this before taking my first stats course!""Outstanding book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"How many times have you wondered how two different people looking at the same report managed to draw totally opposite conclusions? How many times have you looked at a set of data yourself and decided that the data must be wrong because it doesn't show what you ""know"" to be true? Well, I suspect that you aren't alone. I suspect that you also have an aversion to ""doing the math"" necessary to convince yourself that the data is actually correct.Wheelan claims that ""Statistics is like a high-caliber weapon: helpful when used correctly and potentially disastrous in the wrong hands."" This is an incredibly important topic as we move forward into our increasingly connected world where we are creating data at an accelerating rate. The data is only raw knowledge, how we analyze that data is what allows us to derive useful information to create actionable knowledge. The tools we use to analyze the data is, like it or not, statistics. Wheelan gives us an easy to follow and understand overview of statistics. Even if you didn't like math in school, you will find this book useful as well as insightful.Here's the rub. No matter how hard we try, when using descriptive statistics, we lose the detail in the data. We've ""summarized"" it and just like the summary of a good book, we will miss a lot of the nuance in the story. Neither this review nor the summary of data known as descriptive statistics is an exception to that rule. And because of that loss of fidelity, we will find as Wheelan puts its, ""Smart and honest people will often disagree about what the data are trying to tell us.""Wheelan includes many examples of how statistics is enlightening and infuriating. The examples are from everyday life and you are likely to recognize them; things like ""Money Ball"" and the ""Wall Street failure."" You will learn about correlation, basic probability, the Central Limit Theorem, Inferences, Polling, Regression Analysis and more. All without tears!So why should you be interested? Because the big questions will be answered by statistical analysis and you will want to know at least enough to not be ""taken in"" by those who would purposely try and confuse you or convert you to their views using statistics and data. Wheelan believes that there are five ""large"" questions that statistics will help us answer in the future.1. What is the future of football? Will it die of concussions?2. What (if anything) is causing the dramatic rise in the incidence of autism?3. How can we identify and reward good teachers and schools?4. What are the best tools for fighting global poverty?5. Who gets to know what about you?Wheelan doesn't answer these questions. The data is still being collected and analyzed. What he has done, however, is set the reader on the right path to understanding the complexity of those questions and why there aren't any easy answers. He has given the reader at least a working knowledge of statistics so that we can decide for ourselves who is doing the best job of presenting the information and knowledge buried in ever expanding universe of dots for us to connect. The sub title of this excellent book is ""Stripping the dread from the data."" What I found is that now I know how to make sure that I strip the dread from the statistics which applies to the data. The dread is when the proper use of statistics on that data shows my cherished beliefs to be ill conceived!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"In the unfolding Age of Big Data, no one who hopes to understand the way the world works can afford to be ignorant of statistical methods. Not a day goes by that statistical analysis isn't behind some front-page story -- in politics, sports, business, or even entertainment. The statistical concepts of probability, sampling,  and statistical validity, once considered obscure and of interest only to geeks wearing pocket protectors, are now indispensable tools for the active citizen to grasp. Writing in a breezy and intimate style, with humor and lots asides to the reader, Charles Whelan attempts to unpack these concepts and explain them in English with a minimal use of advanced math, and he succeeds . . . up to a point.Naked Statistics was published just four months after Nate Silver's best-selling book, The Signal and the Noise, which covers much the same ground in a very different way. Whelan focuses on the nitty-gritty of statistical methodology, delving into such topics as how samples are chosen, what's meant by terms such as correlation, standard deviation, and regression analysis, and how to determine whether the results of a test are statistically valid. However, he doesn't lose sight of practical questions, unpacking such seemingly puzzling statements as ""the average income in America is not equal to the income of the average American"" and spotlighting the difference between precision and accuracy. Silver instead explains how statistical methods are applied in a wide range of activities, from baseball and basketball to Wall Street. Whelan includes lots of formulas laden with Greek letters, though, conveniently, they're confined for the most part to Appendixes that follow many of the book's chapters and can be skipped by a non-technical reader. (I ignored them.) Silver's book is refreshingly devoid of Greek letters.As Whelan makes clear, perhaps unintentionally, statistics is a forbiddingly technical field. Truth to tell, if you really want to understand statistical methodology and how it can be applied, you need a fair grounding in mathematics and a tolerance for terminology that doesn't appear in everyday English. In fact, you probably need to take the same sort of graduate school courses Whelan took years ago. This is heady stuff!All in all, for a run-of-the-mill mathematical illiterate such as me, Nate Silver did a much better job getting across the significance of statistics and how its methods are applied to strip away the complexities of today's often baffling, data-driven world.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"I just finished reading Naked Statistics by Charles Wheelan.  This book met all my expectations.  It provides an excellent description of the field of statistics.  Although statistics is just a little over 100 years old, it has obviously become the way that we describe the world and at least an intuitive understanding of these concepts is important.  I would strongly recommend this group for two groups of people.  The first group would be people like myself who are interested in the general understanding of statistics and have no desire whatsoever to do any of the manipulations that are necessary if you want to be a real statistician.Mr. Wheelan did an excellent job in describing a number of things that are of great interest to me as a physician.  Those include his excellent discussion of type 1 and type 2 errors, the miracle of regression analysis and how powerful this can be, particularly in medical studies.  Another area is that he described the counter intuitive situation with Monty Hall on Let's Make a Deal about as well as anyone has.  So many times when I read about this, I understand it for an hour or so, but then my old way of thinking seems to slip back in.  When that happens, I am going to go back and review his chapter.The second group of people that I would recommend this for are young people that are starting out in a career in medicine or any other area and especially those that are taking their first statistics class. I think a great problem with education, especially in medical school and postgraduate medical school training, is that the students jump into the middle of statistics without understanding their purpose or their basic concepts and rarely come away with anything more than a mechanical understanding of the subject.I can highly recommend this book for any of the two groups that I have just mentioned.  I would give it a 5-star rating.  Because of this experience, I have just started to read Professor Wheelan's previous book, Naked Economics.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data
"Yes, there are lots of ""dear reader"" type comments throughout the book. Yes, the examples and references are drawn from up-to-the-minute pop culture. And, yes, if you don't know very much about statistics and probability you can learn fairly ""painlessly"" in this book.One drawback: you really, really need to read the entire book from start to finish to really understand all of the concepts. This is not a reference book in which you can ""jump around"" or just go to the parts you have questions about.It's like being given a prescription for antibiotics; you really need to read every chapter in the book, to ""take it all."" Concepts build on previous chapters, up to the final chapter. Don't stop or you will miss out!On the other hand, this is not a book for someone who wants to quickly, at-a-glance understand probability or who wants to get a solid definition of any statistical concept, such as confidence level or regression analysis. It is not specifically a reference book.I confess, my prejudice is for more concise information without all the ""fluff."" On the other hand, I work with opinion survey statistics almost every day of my worklife, so I don't need to be lured in with tales of baseball (in which I have no interest) or discussions of what's behind the doors in Let's Make a Deal. (In fact, I have never, ever seen that show.)However, if you are in business or education or health care and don't have a complete grasp of statistics, I recommend you read this book. If you want to better understand whether you should buy a lottery ticket or buy insurance and you don't understand probability theory, I recommend this book to you. If you read media and want to have a better understanding of polls, scientific experiments, clinical trials and don't understand statistics, then I recommend this book to you.If this book piques your interest in the topics, I suggest you next obtain a couple of the more traditional, ""duller"" stat books that you can use as handy references for specific concepts. Of course, if you already have that much interest in stats, you probably already have those books. Or you know where to go online to find reference materials.There are a few tiny, tiny little things that could have been better. I think he could have included the ""name"" for symbols, such as sigma when he first introduced them. Also, I don't like the way he would ""jump"" back and forth on examples.Overall, I recommend this book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data

"Hands down this is the best applied Bayesian book out there. I read the most of this book (14 out of 15 chapters). To the best of my knowledge, this is the first book pinpointing the details of inducing prior information. It is very PRACTICAL. It deepens your understanding of Bayesian analysis. It has been fun trying to adopt their prior elicitation methods to my datasets and see the actual changes from prior to posterior distributions. Now I can collaborate with non-statisticians and convince them to use use Bayesian ideas. By the way most of the books (such as Gelmans) assume non-infromative prior most of the time or at best they suggest ""ask an expert"" and that is it.Other highlighting points 1)Using their winbugs code and the ideas in the book, I have repeated many of my frequentest analysis using now Bayesian analysis. 2) It has sufficient amount of theoretical material for such introductory book especially in chapters 4 and 6 (you can skip them if you want). 3) Mixed models. I always hated performing GLMM using frequnetest approach (it is not convincing!) . It is straightforward to fit GLMM using Bayesian approach. This is outlined in the book. 4) Easy to follow non-parametric chapter . 5) Practical case studies and examples.You can read my review about the Gelamn's book.

There is no direct connection between plotting with Makie and data in Dataframes. It would also have been nice to see some discussion of packages that use data from Dataframes for Data science, e.g, linear models, etc. Many packages for Julia use plotting package Plots instead of Makie because of the recipe facility in Plots.

"I purchased and read this book because I was interested in learning about what data scientists ""do"" on a day-to-day basis, and the book definitely delivers in that respect.  It is very up-front in stating that it does not cover many of the details (e.g., requisite math/statistics background, coding in R, etc.), but it provides numerous references for learning this material for those who wish to take a deeper dive.  It provides perspectives from a number of experts in the field, along with their associated domains of expertise, and hence appears to give a good sampling of the different backgrounds and personalities of self-labelled data scientists.From a pedagogical perspective, I think it's a valiant attempt to create a class that's not so ""academic.""  The book is a compendium of individual lectures that were the basis of a data science class at Columbia University, and the corresponding assignments were aimed at giving students a flavor of real-world data science problems (where data is messy, specific questions regarding outcomes are not-well-formed, etc.), which I think is an amazingly valuable experience to give students perspective on what the field is about.  But I wonder if the course went a little *too* far into ""the real world is not pretty"" aspect of things.  The students wrote a chapter at the end of the book where they criticize a standard academic problem that comes from a statistical learning textbook and that, in my opinion, is a negative outcome.  While elegant mathematical theories do not describe the complexities of the real world, understanding the subtleties of algorithms is an important part of any scientific field, and to discount that is a disservice to the students.  Too much depth and not enough breadth is bad in the real world, but so is not having *enough* depth.  On the whole, though, I really applaud the approach of the authors at building a ""real-world"" class.One of the things that book has left me pondering is whether there is a clear distinction between data *science* and data *engineering*, and whether it is possible to have clear roles for people who are predominately scientists than those who are predominately engineers.  A few of the guest lecturers claim that 90% of the work of a data scientist is organizing the data, but I can't help but wonder if that's the bias of the individual speakers---that they *like* this component of the work and, therefore, focus on that more, rather than it being an absolute must to spend 90% of your time working on data structuring.  I am sure that if the authors were to read this comment, they would think that I am missing one of their major points (namely, that one can make a lot of mistakes in data leakage and that like from poor data structures, hence making this an integral part of the process).  But I think there's a certain personality type that really loves working on the actually processing component who would otherwise be turned off my too much data structuring if it really composed 90% of the work.  And harnessing the skills from those types of people is undoubtedly invaluable.  So I'm really wondering if many companies are able to break up roles where some people (the scientists) focus more on the processing part, while others (the engineers) focus more on the structuring part.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline
"This is a beautiful, thoughtful survey with excellent references.  I am an academic data scientist with nearly 20 years experience and I wanted a book to offer my students who are starting in the field.  This is it.The ""difficulty"" with data science is in the breadth of skills that are needed. Because data scientists need training in art, communication, statistics, and programming nobody is prepared to handle all the tasks and the neophyte (and expert) will need to fill in around their weaknesses.  This book does a brilliant job of working around that issue.  The writing is superb for a beginning to intermediate reader and the graphics and aside boxes are engaging.  More importantly. the references are plentiful and spot on.  In the areas I know well the authors suggest the things I recommend and where I am weak the recommendations have proven interesting.While this is a broad survey, there is some depth here.  There are formulas throughout but the book does not get bogged down in proofs and derivations.  There are programs written in R code scattered throughout.  The code is nicely commented but there is not a deep dive into how it words.  So, the reader who knows some R will learn a few new tricks but it does not interrupt the flow of the book.A reader who types the R code will run into problems.  Clearly the authors/editors did not attempt to run the code after the type setter mangled it.  For example, on page 39 there is a line which begins with a + and that character needed to be on the previous line.  In other places, (like page 49) functions are invoked (count) but the authors have not included the commands to make the functions available (in this case library(plyr)).  Sadly there does not seem to be an errata for the book and these will be major headaches or show stoppers for novices.While this book could be improved with a code supplement on the web (including the code to make all the graphics, complete solutions to the example/problems and an errata), this is a wonderful buy for readers of all levels.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline

Business sort of demands that over time you narrow problem-defining frameworks, problem-solving techniques, and problem-processing operations to what you can scale and consistently deliver.

(As they say, if you have a hammer, then everything looks like, etc. etc.) This is especially true as things get more complex on all these fronts.  What I appreciated about this book was that even as it is an excellent survey of specific approaches and techniques at the coal-face of their application (there are code samples here, people!), it's also a thoughtful exposition of the limits of these and of the pitfalls they present.  You might be tempted to skip Chapters 15 and 16 if you're just looking to RTFM, but you shouldn't; for me they were the real meat of the book. Maybe it's confirmation bias at work, but it was reassuring to hear such a humble tone coming at the end of such a competent treatment of different data science challenges.  Doing this work very occasionally brings triumph and much more often despair, so it helps to have reminders from seasoned pros that what really matters is just trying, steadily, to get better at your craft.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline
"Not for the general reader.This is a somewhat difficult book about an emerging discipline of Data Science by a pre-eminent practitioner. But it is a necessary book to explain what this discipline encompasses. It is still too early to be absorbed into popular culture.This is really a text book which requires the reader to do the exercises so that the reader can grasp the topics. This is what makes the book difficult for the general reader. One has to be sufficiently competent enough with computers, programming, and statistics in order to appreciate the evolution of Data Science.Despite its difficulty, this book is a necessary introduction for the general public to understand the threat to democratic society from the misuse of Data Science. O'Neil explains this further in her call-to-arms (
Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy
).Unfortunately, public culture still regards computers as magic. Say the right words, and the answer magically appears. Data Science is far more than just using computers -- Data Science involves the collection, analysis, cleaning, and presentation of enormous amounts of data.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline

"It seems there are some misses in the book \emph{Doing Data Science} by Cathy O'Neil and Rachel  Schutt page 61-62 when linear regression was discussed.  First of all, in page 61, in equation $y=x \cdot \beta$, it's perhaps better to indicate  that vector $x$ is different than the $x$ mentioned before. More specifically, $x = [x, 1]$.  More importantly, the target function in page 62:  \begin{equation}  RSS(\beta) = (y - \beta x)^{t}(y - \beta x)  \end{equation}  should be:  \begin{equation}  RSS(\beta) = (y - x \beta)^{t}(y - x \beta)  \end{equation}  Then we have:  \begin{eqnarray*}  \frac{\partial R}{ \partial \beta} &=& \frac{\partial (y - x \beta)^{t}(y - x \beta)}{\partial \beta}\\  &=& 2(y - x \beta)^{t}\frac{\partial(y - x \beta)}{\partial \beta} \\  &=& -2(y - x \beta)^{t}x = 0\\  &\Rightarrow& y^{t}x - \beta^{t}x^{t}x = 0 \\  &\Rightarrow& y^{t}x = \beta^{t}x^{t}x \\  &\Rightarrow& x^{t}y = x^{t}x \beta \\  &\Rightarrow& \beta = (x^{t}x)^{-1}x^{t}y  \end{eqnarray*}",4.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline
"I highly recommend this book to anyone with a genuine interest in data science *as a career*. What I mean by that is this book is not written as a textbook, but rather, as suggested by the title, as a guide to the actual reality of the occupation. Different chapters are based on lectures given by different practitioners in the field, and so the book as a whole gives an excellent holistic perspective on the profession. It took some getting used to, as I did expect more of an academic, textbook treatment---and to be fair, there is quite a bit of statistics and data wrangling in the book. But given that data science is not really a subject, but a job title (one can see this in the history of the term), the book's approach makes total sense. As a handbook for the profession, I found the book to be clear, substantive, and astonishingly thoughtful, particularly in regards to the ethical dimensions of the job. I wish more books would take such an expansive view of their subject.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline
"I work closely with some great data engineers and statistical programmers and am interested in practical applications of these skills. Generally, textbooks on statistics and machine learning are purely academic, but here the techniques are treated in the context of solving problems with data. The reality of working with real-world data is that it is rarely ready for analysis in its original state – it's a challenge to clean and organize. Applying the right analysis and gleaning insight is only possible with that groundwork.The style of the book is informal and friendly and different than most technical books. This makes it accessible to beginners or more experienced professionals who want a new angle on a topic with which they're familiar – it may be a turn-off to those who are looking for a more traditional approach. The book is not traditional – it has a style of its own and asks fundamental questions about the role data plays in our society.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline

"I bought this book as I was preparing for job interviews for data scientist positions. The book is a great overview of the general field of analyzing large datasets and building models. It strikes just the right balance between mathematical rigor and approachability. Specifically, every concept that is introduced is always accompanied by a real example involving real data, so its great to see what a particular method does to a set of numbers which, in my mind, is the clearest way to understand what an algorithm is actually doing. This book also served for me as a quick primer to R, as long as you are familiar with some other package for data handling & modeling (e.g. spss or matlab) the book got me comfortable with R very quickly.

"Dr. Robert I. Kabacoff's R in Action has been my go-to R reference book since its first edition came out in 2011. I reviewed the second edition here on Amazon in 2015 and have been relying on that book since then. I have never used R frequently enough to get really good at it. Yet, when I do need to work with it, I have grabbed my now well-used copy of R in Action, Second Edition, and found the instructions and examples needed to complete my tasks. (It's still a good book for getting started with R, by the way.) That said, R in Action, Third Edition, is a real eye-opener for me. I didn't realize the program had gained so many enticing new features and capabilities over the past seven years. Kabacoff's updated book includes ""extensive coverage of tidyverse approaches to data management and analysis."" At least nine of the book's chapters and  three of its appendices have been expanded and updated. Some corrections and changes also have been made to examples and descriptions carried over from the second edition. In all, more than 200 pages of new material are presented. Some of the new sections include how to use RStudio ""for programming, debugging, report writing, and package creation..."" The package creation descriptions also cover ""how to share and promote your packages through CRAN, GitHub, and software-generated websites."" The latest edition is a hefty book, now nearly 600 pages in print form. Many of us today are dealing with new surges of data, and we need better ways to manipulate it, format it, display it, and manage it for the most efficient storage and retrieval. The tidyverse approach to data management and data analysis has its critics and its advocates. I don't know enough about it yet to render an opinion. But whether you are an R newcomer, an intermediate user, or someone who uses R extensively each day, you should consider having R in Action, Third Edition, within easy reach. You'll likely need it in the months and years ahead.My thanks to Manning Publications for sending a review copy.",5.0 out of 5 stars,R in Action Third Edition: Data analysis and graphics with R and Tidyverse

"I bought the ebook directly from the publisher, Manning. I especially liked the examples and the practical approach. I have used and taught R for a number of years, and I found the examples useful and will be using some of them in class, too. However, I would not recommend this book for absolute beginners: the author has opted to base his exposition on RStudio, ggplot2 and ""Tidyverse"" packages like dplyr, instead of sticking to base R and introducing powerful high performing packages like data.table. I do not follow his reasoning (""most powerful and popular""), certainly not when it comes to learning R in the first place. Unfortunately, many authors rewrite their books because they feel that the ""Tidyverse"" and its approach is the way of the future. I have a more sceptical position towards these developments (please check out ""TidyverseSceptic"" on GitHub for more details). Hence, for beginners, I think the 2nd edition of this book is to be preferred over the 3rd edition. The 2nd edition is just brilliant, and I am glad that I obtained it from Manning for free when buying the 3rd edition. In practice, I often use the ""livebook"" version of the book (another innovation by Manning - see picture).",5.0 out of 5 stars,R in Action Third Edition: Data analysis and graphics with R and Tidyverse

"I used the first edition of this work to learn R. I Found it a pleasant textbook, methodical, exhaustive and clearly written. As such it was a book that I thoroughly enjoyed. In the meantime, much time has passed; R has evolved and many novel things were introduced. Perhaps the most important of these is the Tidyverse family of libraries. This third edition has grown to include all these new developments. It has become encyclopaedic in size and can be considered a standard work on the subject. If one has to choose one book for work or study, this is the one. The clarity of exposition found in this work is also due to the numerous clear and beautiful illustrations. Apart from a panoramic view of the R programming language it is also a great help in implementing most statistical techniques and to solve inherent programming problems.

Sometimes the rigourous mathematical notation is difficult to follow on the initial reading.  Most algorithms are implemented in Python but the code should be more clearly documented so that one can follow the implementation of the solution without getting stuck on coding issues as the book encourages the reader to focus on the algorithm and to not treat the python code as a black box.  The list of references is quite complete and it was interesting to check my library to see just how many of the references I already had.

I've learned a great deal from this book so far & I'm only about 6 chapters in.If you're just getting started in the world of SQL, ""SQL for Data Analytics"" is an excellent guide.Working my way through the book has given me a solid understanding of the content & has enabled me to expand beyond the examples provided & build useful queries that are already proving their worth to my team.Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,SQL for Data Analytics: Harness the power of SQL to extract insights from data 3rd Edition
"The book SQL for Data Analytics, Third Edition is a great resource for beginners who have had some basic exposure to SQL and intermediate to high level users alike and covers a wide range of use of this versatile data retrieval and manipulation language. For anyone looking to have a career in data analytics/analysis, SQL is a must-have and in-demand skill so having the right foundational knowledge of the different ways to use it is key.The beginning chapter gives a quick, broad level overview of the data analytics, data analysis, statistics, and working with data sets. Some of the topics could be its own book in and of itself; but the authors did a good job of giving a high level overview and resultant mini-exercises to reinforce the readers’ understanding of them. This chapter does not go into the SQL language just yet but prepares the reader for the types of analysis they will be doing with it.The next chapters focus on the syntax and structure of making SQL queries. Basics such as the SELECT statement, etc are covered in good detail with sample exercises given using a PostgreSQL working environment which they ask you to install on your computer. It also goes over CRUD functions and concepts such as case when, aggregate functions and other helpful statements that most people will use with SQL. The exercises are lined up perfectly after a concept is introduced in order to reinforce them. I appreciated some of the minute details and tips such as how to determine whether every value in a column is unique and other helpful query examples that one might run into in your day to day business needs.After the chapter on Window functions, which is a more intermediate use case, the book goes into concepts that are more advanced in nature and will be appreciated by more veteran analysts such as using python to read/write data in your database using pandas and working with more complex data types such as geospatial, array, and JSON. It also goes over tips and techniques on how to make your SQL more efficient and ends with a case study that the reader can then draw from all the skills learned in the book.The book is very thorough in showing how versatile SQL can be - maybe a little too thorough in some regards. For example, the section on text analytics is very appreciated (I personally was not aware of being able to tokenize text in SQL). However, for most data folks I believe other languages such as R and Python are preferred to conduct text analytics.Overall, I highly recommend this book as it speaks to both data analysts or scientists alike with a wide range of abilities in trying to optimize their understanding of SQL alongside real-world business use cases.",5.0 out of 5 stars,SQL for Data Analytics: Harness the power of SQL to extract insights from data 3rd Edition
"Full disclosure: I did not read this book in depth, only skimmed the content and read some chapter summaries.That being said, I would recommend this volume to anyone who is starting their journey with data and is able to dedicate regular time to learning about it. Although the described target audience is existing professionals in the industry, the book is set up more like a textbook for a classroom setting, complete with very lengthy instructions on setting up a learning environment on your computer.You are going to need to commit to working through all the content; this is not a book of 'helpful hints'. I particularly liked the emphasis on learning and maintaining good data practices and using proper conventions when constructing code.Our modern world is increasingly dependent on data and the skills contained in this book are invaluable to anyone who is helping influence business decisions.",4.0 out of 5 stars,SQL for Data Analytics: Harness the power of SQL to extract insights from data 3rd Edition
"“SQL for Data Analytics” is an excellent book that is beneficial for both a new SQL learner as well as providing helpful guidance for more knowledgeable SQL users. It would work well in the classroom setting, as well as for an individual learning on their own.I appreciate that this text starts before the use of SQL for gaining a broader understanding of data and relevant statistic concepts. Each chapter begins with an overview and ends with a summary, which really helps the reader to understand where they are going next and how the concepts build upon one another. The text does not leave you wondering where you are in the process of learning SQL. It provides relevant examples that build along with the lessons, all the way up to a case study that rounds out all of the knowledge from the earlier lessons.I recommend this title for anyone wanting to learn more about SQL, whether you are in a class with others, or learning on your own, it will be of great service to your learning as you follow along with the concepts and examples.My only caveat about this book is that some of the software versions that they give examples from and instruction on how to use are a few years old, with a few slight variations due to upgrades. They do provide step-by-step instruction on downloading and using these programs for Windows, Mac, and Linux, which is very helpful, but do note that some parts may be slightly different if you have a newer version of a program or operating system.I received this copy of “SQL for Data Analytics” in return for writing this review, this in no way shaped my thoughts on this book. As a former professor and current practitioner in data analysis and SQL I recommend this book regardless.",5.0 out of 5 stars,SQL for Data Analytics: Harness the power of SQL to extract insights from data 3rd Edition
A fantastic book that will get you from a beginner to an intermediate SQL user.  The book starts off covering the basics before moving on to advance analytics using SQL.I really enjoyed how the authors have broken down the topics into simple English that anyone can understand. I have read other SQL books where I had to read paragraphs a few times before I understood what the author was trying to convey. I wish this book was out earlier so I did not have to read other SQL books. This book is well worth the investment to help you level up your SQL skillset.,5.0 out of 5 stars,SQL for Data Analytics: Harness the power of SQL to extract insights from data 3rd Edition
"I had a privilege of previewing this book and I have to say, the information in this book is great! It gives a good introduction on SQL topics as well as going in-depth in SQL. One of the things that I found helpful was that they had images of the data, then SQL queries, then images of what the output would look like after the queries. It really helps to get a visual understanding of what the queries are doing without having to run the code yourself. I will definitely be referencing back to this book in the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars,SQL for Data Analytics: Harness the power of SQL to extract insights from data 3rd Edition

"I have been in the SQL/Data Analytics space for about a year now, but still novice/intermediate. One can learn from peers quote well, but can learn more in depth sometimes from books. This so happens to be the case here.I thoroughly enjoyed going through the SQL sections as it helped me gain better knowledge of how better to use SQL for Data Analytics as opposed to just throwing a query together for a report export.The book not only provides examples and good talking points, but also provides great examples to demonstrate what is taking place.I’m absolutely amazed at the depth of knowledge that this book contains. It doesn’t just skim over the top as a lot of other books do.I’m a fan of this book and will continue to use it as a reference point for any questions that may come up.",5.0 out of 5 stars,SQL for Data Analytics: Harness the power of SQL to extract insights from data 3rd Edition
An excellent and insightful look into SQL. This book is easily digestible and the authors give very concise and easy to follow instructions on both setting up the PostGres server as well as giving great exercises to follow that one can upload to their own GitHub to show experience.

"Tldr 4.5Pro: great sense of humor, excellent analogies to the data structures in the real world (not just but often coffee based)Cons: Pseudo code is a little unclear. Author explains desire to be language agnostic but is written in a weird C and Python mixThe book covers the usual introductory data structures and adds in a few more specialized structures for fun. It also walks through related algorithms. Each chapter typically involves real world examples—making maps, searching a book, etc. Definitely plenty of coffee based examples. The author uses tons of humor and puns which I enjoyed. But if you want a no-nonsense approach then probably don’t want to buy a book with fun in the title.As stated the pseudo-code examples are a little tricky to follow due to the mix of explanations, C type structs, Python like white space, and types (written out rather than usual abbreviations). This being said the illustrations with the code are excellent and walk through the main methods on each data structure. Also lack of BigO notation for the algorithms is a little disappointing. But at least the author address memory vs speed and flexibility vs memory.Overall excellent intro.

"As the other review remarked. If you've been using R daily for 4 years, this might be the book for you. If your are trying to learn R, this is not the book for you.This book is mediocre in it presentation of R and poor in it teaching of probability and statistic. It takes a special gift to teach those topics. They are exceptionally confusing to learn because of the plethora of seemingly random formulas. There are a good textbooks on this, but sadly, this is not one of them. I read the book online as part of a course and quite frankly, I'm surprised it was able to get published.The explanations are not particularly clear, the examples are glossed over and the organizations is a bit random.. The author is probably a whiz at stats, but that is a whole different set of skills to be a teacher of R, stats, and data science.To learn R,  Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund are simply superb.

"According to the author, those are notes to several Data Science courses from Harvard.The case studies are extremely interesting ranging from diseases, casinos, and even to Francis Galton’s height dataset (the birth of regression).My favorite was the wide use of Monte Carlo simulations.Don’t let the book title “Introduction to Data Science” fool you. While the author covers the basics, he dives into some advanced topics in full code (e.g. the Monty Hall or Birthday problem). Regarding “code”, he uses R code a lot and almost on any page (nice!).This “Harvard style” shows clearly, in my opinion. The author pushes the reader hard and, in my opinion, several topics (e.g. Moneyball) are not required for being a good Data Scientist. But, I believe, the goal is to push the reader to his limits.It’s a big book in hard-cover, but not in color.There are 38 chapters. With so many chapters, any reader should find very useful chapters.My personal highlights:- 9.5.2: Which base to use? Log10? Log2?- 13.2: Monte Carlo simulation for categorical data. In my opinion, the foundation for learning the exciting world of bootstrapping.- 14.2: How we can generate data on drawings from an urn. Here, you’re the owner of a casino and wonder, if you can make money with roulette.- 14.7: he uses a Monte Carlo simulation to show the Central Limit Theorem.- 16.5: Monte Carlo simulation for a disease.- 19.1 (spurious correlation): he runs a Monte Carlo simulation to create a synthetic dataset to show that we can find high correlations among uncorrelated variables.- 19.3 (reverse cause and effect): we can see that the David Robinson (creator of the broom R package) helped. Great linear regression (lm) done in tidyverse with the help of broom. An example I could not find in “R for Data Science.”Epic.FrancoPS: I love to buy great books and use highlights and notes. Yes, you can get the book for free, but I like to spend time off-screen. Yes, you can get the video lectures (same as text) for free, but videos are in general too slow for me.

"This is a nice, simple, and comprehensive introduction on how to go about doing Machine Learning in R programming environment and I would have definitely recommended it for beginners were it not for the incredibly high number of either minor typos or just outright wrong text included in this book. There are pages where the author is saying one thing, while the code and the results are showing something else. In some places, the author refers to Appendix for additional statistical details, but there is no such Appendix to be found. As a beginner myself, I spent many minutes self-flagellating over why I didn't understand something that was obvious to the author before I realized that there was an error in the book. If you were to buy this book, I would recommend that you code along and not rely on the outputs shown in the book.

However, this book has a surprising number of errors. These were mostly instances where the text showed one value, but the sample output showed another, perhaps due to code being re-run without using the same random seed. There were also instances where figure references were wrong.

I also liked the fact that the author chose to use only the R-base package rather than the Tidyverse, so that everything can be understood withouth assuming previous knowledge. I think that to begin with ML using R this is definitely a book to have on the shelf...However, the amount of typos is annoying. The code ouput is often different from the one explained (see picture for an example). Being a book for beginners the fact the a confusion matrix cannot be accurately explained makes it hard to confidently go through the more complex parts.

"In this book, authors try their best to explain everything from scratch which is perfect for anyone without any exposure to data science or Python programing language, in general. Authors start with a very nice preface that allows readers to easily set-up their systems and properly follow exercises in the book. Moreover, the GitHub repository provides a very good set of examples that readers can always refer to for their own problems.In section 1 and 2, authors introduce Pandas python package to load, explore, manipulate and play with the data. However, I found some given information very redundant. Therefore, one may skip many parts that are repeated over and over.I also found some parts confusing. For instance in the table on Page 36 (Fig. 1.34), the column ""category"" is supposed to have missing values (replaced by NaN) while the entire column is dropped and missing. This can be fixed in the later editions of the book.I wish this book was using more colorful set of plots. It was very hard for me to follow the segmentation methods such as K-means clustering just by looking at grayscale plots. However, readers can easily find the colorful version of plots in the GitHub repository of the book or by following the codes when repeating the exercises. I believe authors did a great job in their presentation and explaining all relevant phenomena in Chapters 3 and 4. I learned many business terms and a bunch of new segmentation techniques as well.In Chapter 5, linear regression is introduced as a prediction tool. Data correlations, data cleaning, and feature extraction are the concepts that are nicely explained with appropriate visualizations. Authors took an analytical approach in their presentation.Chapter 6 starts with introducing multiple model evaluation metrics. Authors continue with presenting the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method from scikit-learn to prune unimportant features. They continue with decision trees and random forest regressors as alternative powerful tools for regression.Chapter 7 is devoted to classification methods such as logistic regression. Authors present how to build a data-science pipeline that starts with extracting, cleaning and transforming data and ends with building a reasonably trained model that is capable of making valid predictions.In the middle of chapter 7, I felt I am lost in the author's train of thoughts. Then I went back and I reviewed the previous chapters too. Author's presentation is confusing in a sense that each chapter doesn't necessarily follow a clear avenue in presenting a single method or model.For instance in the beginning of Chapter 7, the basics of classification is presented, however the main body of the classification is remained for Chapter 8. Readers might as well jump to Chapter 8 after they read about logistic regression in Chapter 7 and then go back to the data-science pipeline in the remaining part of Chapter 7. In my opinion, data-science pipeline/methodology could be the final concept that this book could end with.I really enjoyed Chapters 8 and 9. These two chapters cover everything one needs to know about classification techniques. Also authors cover many other ideas in data science and concisely explain many common practices in machine learning projects.In summary, I strongly recommend this book to any data-science enthusiast and novice learner with minimum or no prior knowledge of data analytics, data science or business. I benefited from the business terminologies and examples in the book. This book also provides a good bridge for those in the data analytics business who are planning to transition to data science or those who attempt to bring more tools and programming capabilities to their day-to-day work flows.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Marketing Analytics: A practical guide to forming a killer marketing strategy through data analysis with Python 2nd Edition
"I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for sharing an honest and unbiased review.Upon first glance of the table of contents, this breadth of information covered in this book is extensive. Topics from initial data exploration, cleaning, and visualization, to the application of various machine learning algorithms, are all covered. There are ample definitions and clear explanations of concepts.Something I found particularly useful were all the practical examples of the techniques. A common shortcoming of these type of references books is their creation of toy examples that do not translate well to real world data and scenarios. However, I did not find that to be the case in this book.Another thing that I found to be great about this book is its GitHub accompaniment. The exercises shown in the book can be followed along on users' local machines which can be incredibly helpful for those looking for hands-on practice.However, while I respect the authors' decision to first introduce clustering methods for customer segmentation, I do wonder if introducing unsupervised learning methods prior to supervised learning methods is the best order for those new to the world of machine learning. For beginners, supervised learning might be easier to grasp due to the evaluation metrics that can be used to understand model performance. Many people have had at least some exposure to linear regression, which is where I would have thought this book may have began its foray into machine learning.All in all, this book is a great resource for those looking to expand their marketing skill sets!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Marketing Analytics: A practical guide to forming a killer marketing strategy through data analysis with Python 2nd Edition
"I was given a copy of this book to review.This is a great resource for anyone interested in Marketing Analytics. Specifically Marketing analytics leveraging Python.This is a book meant for beginners interested in building more skills to advance their career. It requires a basic understanding of Python and marketing concepts.  Given the beginner’s perspective it doesn’t go far into detail about specific data sources and dealing with more advanced analytics techniques. Rather it gives the reader a foundation that they can further tailor as they grow.As a previous reviewer noted, the book from the second chapter on is great. Especially when it begins detailing specific techniques used in common use cases.The first chapter takes on quite a bit with introducing Python, Data manipulation and cleaning. Consequently Data cleaning gets a little skimmed over. Considering how much of this field requires data cleansing at the beginner level. However it does do a good job summarizing when Python is advantageous over tools like excel and when excel may be appropriate — a conversation I personally believe is overlooked.I feel this book is a good book to begin your marketing analytics journey and an even better book to keep at your desk long term. This book won’t be your last in your journey but it is a good beginner reference book to keep.

As a data engineer for many years myself, I wish we had books like this when I was learning about machine learning and data mining. I have learned a few libraries on displaying the results. However, we generally use other reporting tools for charting.I wish the authors had added a chapter talking about other tools such as tensorflow, pytorch, and/or pyspark, etc. The field of machine learning is developing very rapidly in terms of new algorithms to solve existing problems and new problems.

First of all, the book teaches most of the essential analytics skills and models under different marketing use cases, which is much useful to help readers understand how to use data science to help inform marketing decision making. Second, it is easy to follow and understand, focusing on application rather than theory. Also it covers most of the basic knowledge and models used in Marketing analytics so it's good for beginner or entry level data analysts/data scientists to learn. However, it doesn't address some advanced topics like MTA, MMM, and causal inference, which would be very useful for people who are already in marketing data science industry.

It continued with explanations of exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, unsupervised techniques such as clustering for marketing segmentation, linear regression for predicting revenues, and other several machine learning algorithms.This book is useful for entry-level data scientists or students looking to practice with toy projects for building their portfolios. The explanation was easy to understand and the codes were explained in detail so the readers were not left wondering why the codes were written in certain ways.However, the sample provided did not fully reflect actual marketing data from different data sources with varying file formats, naming conventions, logic, and columns. Ideally, there should be a chapter on ETL processes and data harmonization to apply additional rules and transformation to raw marketing data before being able to consolidate those data into one cohesive, analysis-ready dataset.Despite having subtitled ""A practical guide to forming a killer marketing strategy"", I would say that this book lacks foundational concepts of marketing and lacks discussion of translating/breaking down business problems to data science problems.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Marketing Analytics: A practical guide to forming a killer marketing strategy through data analysis with Python 2nd Edition
"This book is a good reference guide that offers easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions on dealing with marketing data in Python. However, I wouldn't really recommend it to people who don't have a background in either Marketing or Data Science (so you would need to be familiar with both), because the book misses a lot of foundational points for both fields necessary to make the analyses valid. Issues like multicollinearity are not explored, which can make the book seem like it just instructs the reader to apply various models to any dataset, so a data science course or two would be necessary to get you up to speed with the instruction the book is missing. With regards to marketing applications, the coverage is a bit basic, and to be honest, won't give you much of an edge, strategy-wise.Given these, you should at least be a data scientist-in-training looking to dip your toes in the field of marketing analysis, or a marketing analyst who has taken a beginner's data science courses. Once you have that out of the way, the book is great with its super hands-on approach, and it simplifies the process with the hand-holding. All the steps are well-explained, and the amount of case studies and practical examples that come with the book make it great for self-study. Easily a 3.5/5!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Marketing Analytics: A practical guide to forming a killer marketing strategy through data analysis with Python 2nd Edition
"All seven chapters of this book contain a TON of helpful information and useful code examples. Here’s a quick overview of each chapter:CHAPTER 1Starts with a brief introduction to the current state of marketing and data science, and then dives right into code. I liked that the code example shows a few of the parameters that can be used with pd.read_csv(). I think a lot of people just use the function but never realize that it has a lot of extra capabilities, like controlling which specific columns are imported, adding column names, etc.If you go through these exercises and try out each of the functions shown, you'll be well on your way to getting comfortable with data manipulation. In one of the examples, the data imports incorrectly by default, and you have to go back and fix it. That's very true to reality, so I really appreciated that being included.CHAPTER 2Starts off by introducing the concept of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and gives six examples of the most common. It's very common to be asked to derive any of those KPIs from a dataset, so this introduction is very relevant.This chapter had lots of great examples of using groupby(), which is very helpful for summarizing data. I wish I would have had this example when I was learning! Also, the whole section on reshaping data with stacking/unstacking and pivot tables is very interesting and potentially useful if you are working with data that is too big for Excel but would like to leverage the helpful features available in Excel.One thing that could be confusing to a new Python user is the authors' frequent use of method chaining. It's not complex, but it can be intimidating if you are new to it. Just don't be intimidated when you see df.groupby('Column Name').sum().plot() all at once instead of broken out into 2-3 separate code cells.CHAPTER 3It feels like you make quick progress. By chapter 3, you're starting exercises already using Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I like that the author shows how to quickly segment customers with simple visualization as well as how to use unsupervised machine learning. Both approaches have practical benefit.I love principal components analysis (PCA), so I'm really glad this was included. Dimension reduction is fascinating, and I didn't expect it to get a nod in this book. I would have liked for there to be a bit more explanation about how it works because it's helpful, but I also recognize that there is only so much that can be included in a chapter.CHAPTER 4This chapter introduces some great clustering methods, including k-modes and k-prototypes that can be used with categorical data. I was really excited to see that! It also provided a good introduction to visual and sum of squared error methods as well as silhouette scores for evaluating clustering solutions. The final segmentation exercise in the chapter was also very interesting and relevant.CHAPTERS 5 & 6These chapters covered feature engineering using the agg() groupby method, residuals analysis, and even Recursive Feature Elimination. A lot of good analysis info here.One important thing to note: Some of the code syntax in the feature engineering exercise is not explained, so don't feel dumb if you're new to Python. Just plan to spend some extra time understanding what you're doing.CHAPTER 7This chapter is primarily about logistic regression. The explanation is definitely the most math-heavy of the book. I feel like the authors could have spent more time explaining the basic concept of the logit transformation, but instead they focused on the math. Take your time when reading through it, and be prepared to think hard if the concepts are new. You may need to supplement with some YouTube videos or blog posts.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Marketing Analytics: A practical guide to forming a killer marketing strategy through data analysis with Python 2nd Edition
Praktisch en leerzaam boek.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hands-On Data Science with R: Techniques to perform data manipulation and mining to build smart analytical models using R
"I have no doubt that this is probably the fastest book ever written. I'm so annoyed I didn't think of it myself first.Here's how to do it. Email 25 data scientists from top companies and ask them to fill out a form with some questions: ""What's your background?"", ""How did you end up here at XYZ?"", ""What constitutes a top data scientist?"". Next, copy and paste the replies into a document, format it a bit, and voilá, there's your book.The first thing you'll learn here is that if you ask mathematicians what constitutes a top data scientist, they'll tell you it is mathematical skills. If you ask engineers, they'll tell you it's engineering skills. Statisticians? You guessed it, it's statistical reasoning. And so on. They are all right, but that doesn't mean the information is highly valuable. Data science is known to encompass a large circle of disciplines that favor or punish skill specificity depending on the industry.As such, this book could have easily been half the size without losing much, mostly because a lot of space is devoted to personal stories, background, etc. You get a total of 25 completely formulaic interviews that get boring by the time you get to number 10.The worst thing for me is that if this is the first book you pick up about data science, you might get the wrong idea of the profession: you need to get a Ph.D., you need to work like a madman (or madwoman), you need to learn all the tech and programming languages under the sun, then you might have what it takes... Sure, those things help but they are not the only road.It could have been a much better read had the author spent time aggregating the information provided and synthesizing it for the curious reader rather than spitting out every section verbatim.Sometimes interesting.

"The Data Science Handbook gathers 25 interviews of Data Scientists. Interviews are well done, most questions depending on the previous answer. This gives a nice feeling of discussion between the interviewer and the Data Scientist. On the content side, it provides interesting insights about the job of Data Scientist. The book is however biased towards pioneers in the field spending 14h a day working, which is definitely not representative of the overall Data Scientist population.The 25 interviews are covering all major Data Science topics, including data preparation, automation, Big Data, the role of the Data Scientist and moving from academy to industry. Although some of the selected Data Scientists are clearly well known (DJ Patil, Hilary Mason, etc.), others are quite new to the field. It looks like they have been interviewed because they knew the editors or work for a “trendy” company. I would have rather chosen to include other key Data Scientists such as Dean Abbott, John Elder, Eric Siegel and Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro. The book still remains a great source of inspiration for experienced Data Scientists.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Science Handbook: Advice and Insights from 25 Amazing Data Scientists

"About the book:Data Science Handbook is a collection of in-depth interviews with 25 super smart Data Scientists who are well known for what they do. In Introduction section of the book, authors mention on which interviews will be useful to whom? Such as, aspiring Data Scientists should read interviews from Will, Clare and Diane. I would argue that irrespective of where you are in your career, all the interviews are equally helpful and amazing. For example, as a BI Consultant, who started studying Data Science recently, interviews of Drew Conway and Bradley Voytek were absolutely fantastic because Drew's interview introduced me to term Social Scientist and awesome stuff that he does with data science knowledge to make difference.Goods:Although authors would have prepared the list of questions before approaching these super busy people, the interviews feel natural and the follow up questions seem to be structured in such a way that encouraged and in case of people like Kunal Punera excited them to speak a lot more.With every interview, you find something new which kept me interested. For example, Dj Patil talking about Text Line. I had no idea about this initiative but once I read a bit more about it, I thought it was an amazing initiative. As a guy who does not live in US and isn't surrounded by news around these sort of projects, I loved how it introduced me to these projects.Highlight section throughout the book is well used and is informative.There is a variety of viewpoints on how to approach a career. For example, DJ rubbishes 10,000 hours rule and Luis Sanchez advocates 10,000 hours rule. There are other pieces of advice which are contradictory, which I believe is one of the strengths of the book. Also reminds me of the answer Soleio's answer to Why is advice largely useless? on Quora.comRecurrent theme among all the Scientists was to just do the project and not wait till you develop full stack of knowledge. Following quote by Joe Blitzstein sums it up well.It’s a dangerous way of thinking — that until you know X, Y, Z and W, you’re not going to be able to do data science.My Favourite Interview : Sean Gourley. Didn't know who he was before reading this interviewBads:None actually. I have never read Interview style book, so I have nothing to compare against.One thing I wish it had was a question ""What are your favourite non-technical books?"". I think people like myself who are reading this to become better thinker would have greatly benefited from answers to this one question. I browse around a lot to find how to think better and which books to read. Finding out their favourite non-technical book would have been a good help.For future versions, I wish it includes data scientists from other countries and not just US. I think Data scientists in developing countries such as India can add different flavor to the book. At the same time, Data scientists in countries such as Australia, may come up with ideas on how to initiate when there is no strong community around data.Overall, excellent book. I was going to pirate the book but became victim of William Chen 's experiment and paid under ""Pay what you want"" program. And it was totally worth it.[Disclosure: I have received a free physical copy of the book from authors]",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Science Handbook: Advice and Insights from 25 Amazing Data Scientists
"The Data Science Handbook is a very interesting book in the sense that it reminded me of another book named ""Founders at Work"" written by Jessica Livingston.(Link here : http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Early/dp/1430210788) Both of the books posses similar formats which is to create a collection of interviews of people from respective domains which are data science and entrepreneurship.The book focuses more on the 'life-story' of some of the reputed data scientists working in different companies, either as employees or as founder of companies. The authors asked the data scientists about their early life, what motivated them to enter the industry or how they started working in the data science domain, what courses they took during undergraduate or graduate studies that helped them to enter the industry and afterwards and how they think that data science will be impacting future.What I liked most about the book is that they included stories from data scientists who transitioned from employment to entrepreneurship. I don't think there are that many people available who did that yet. Yes, there's Quid, Kaggle, Datarobot etc but I don't know many. Also, the stories were very diverse since all 25 scientists are currently focusing on different domains.For example, there's this interview from Riley Newman who's from AirBNB and Airbnb is a relatively new company, but there's also the interview from Drew Conway, who's famous for his coining of the data science ven-diagram ; Sean Gourley is well-known for his application of mathematical modelling to middle-east war, while Jace Kohlmeier switched from high frequency trading to help Khan Academy in revolutionizing education and self learning. There are also interviews of people from Facebook (company), Palantir Technologies and some more niche companies which I didn't know before because they are not completely consumer focused or their customers aren't in my age group.It's noticeable that all the people in the book talked about the importance of effective communication for a data scientist and valued the ability to ask good questions. Almost everyone also talked about the value of strong coding, visualization and experimental design skills. My personal favorite so far would be Sean Gourley because I basically liked his working style during PHD. Unlike other students who generally try to stay in a narrow problem, he followed his curiosity and started modelling war in middle east of all things.Terrorism also happens to one of my key-interests, even though I've always been interested in terrorist psychology over their team networks, so I liked his interview tremendously. He has good insights on how to transition from data science to and as I told before entrepreneurship. He also seemed to be interested in making people data-literate and focused the importance of data scientists gaining more decision-making power. I personally don't believe that storytelling or working as an evangelist is the only thing that data scientists can or should focus on in near future, getting the decision making power as founders or politicians is important and more people will eventually be interested in it, despite what people think about 'millennials' right now. So it was refreshing to know that there are other people who are thinking in my ways.I also really liked the John Foreman interview, who happens to be the chief data scientist of MailChimp, he focused on creating different metrics for user experience which might be considered 'creative' in so-many ways because they focus on the human-dimension more than the conversion rate only. For example, he talked about how they put billboards of Mailchimp logo(with a chimp in it!) to create a personal joke between the user and the company even if they don't know how many users convert after watching their logo, which is likely to be small because they didn't put their company name there.  These kind of things matter for me because I feel like that it's true that user experience design decisions can/should be heavily influenced by data but in the end human dimensions and our decision making style also influence our perception to users a lot more than we generally think. He doesn't seem to like Kaggle competitions much , while I am interested in getting better in Kaggle, but well, it's better to get different perspectives.I'm glad that this book didn't focus much on things like ""What is data science? How can we define it?"" style conceptual questions, mostly because I feel like that if one person can 'define' a whole growing industry in a narrow way, then that industry must not be neither big nor high growth which is not true when it comes to data science. It's true that different people had different opinions on where data science is going, but that's more or less expected.Update : I received a free copy in exchange for this review here.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Science Handbook: Advice and Insights from 25 Amazing Data Scientists
"I have a somewhat different take on this book than the other two reviews posted to date.  However, I've read them both, and they're legitimately laudatory, so please read on.I posted a brief review on Quora.com -- where I first read about the book -- as follows:""Interesting reading.  I was expecting/hoping for a little more in the way of case studies, food for thought about conceptualization of data requirements and use of big data, etc.  However, if you have an entrepreneurial bent or are interested in understanding more about how some of the number wizards look at industry uses of data, it's worth a read.""To amplify on this take, I'd like to make it clear that I approached it from a general reader's perspective... as a potential user of big data and as someone looking to learn more about how to make the leap from owning a bucketful of information to turning it into real knowledge.  That kind of work is still needed; this isn't it.  The worlds of data science and customers of the fruits of data science still are pretty widely separated.That said, this book appears to be an excellent atlas to the specialty and the solid guide to the best route toward formation of data science practitioners (although definitely outside my experience enough that at least a good chunk of its wisdom probably was lost on me).  I also got a sense that it offers insights that might help data scientists become better at reaching out to potential users of their services, which also would be a positive.So, for those in the target audience, possessing at least some of the basic quantitative and analytic skills the field requires, I'd unequivocally endorse this book.  For others (like me), it can serve as a means of understanding at least some of the skill set that can be expected of data science practitioners.  However, it's a lot tougher read without at least some background in the area, and I have a strong sense that I didn't get everything out of it that was there for data science cognoscenti.",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Science Handbook: Advice and Insights from 25 Amazing Data Scientists

"If you're not familiar with the Oxford Press series of very short introductions to many topics, the Big Data book by Professor Holmes at U Cal, Santa Barbara packs a lot of information into a relatively short book (112 pages in paperback). The book is well-written, but as always in this series, there's a lot of information in the book so your attention to the material will be required.Who's the audience? You can't read many articles without encountering the term ""big data"" so if you're intellectually curious about what that term means, then the book will provide the necessary information. If you're a student or you have a student in your house who expresses interest in learning about data science, then this would be a good introduction to the area. If you're in business and you've heard about other businesses incorporating big data into their business model and you think that you might like to do so as well, then make the commitment to read the book. It won't take long to read it, you'll come away with an overview of the subject, and maybe you'll have some thoughts about how big data might be useful in your business.What does the book contain? First, the author looks defines ""data"" and briefly looks at how data has been used for thousands of years. In chapter 2 of the book the author defines big data and looks at some of its special characteristics. The author looks at how big data is employed in detecting credit card fraud. Clustering data plays a role here - the author explains how. Chapter 3 explains how data is stored. Hadoop, a spftware fpr a distributed file system, plays an important role in storing data. Structured and unstructured data are described and characterized. SQL and NoSQL databases are described and simple examples are included for these databases.I especially enjoyed the author's description of how data is compressed. I didn't know that data can be compressed with no loss of information (lossless data compression) and it can be compressed with some loss of information (lossy data compression). The book describes when each type of compression is used.Examples of big data analytics for MapReduce and, to a lesser extent, Google's PageRank are given. The author uses simple examples, and these helped me get a better idea for what was actually going on in the analytical process. The actual process is much more complex.The book describes the use of big data in medicine and business. In the chapter on medicine the book describes why Googles' effort to predict flu trends was largely unsuccessful. This chapter helps to explain some of the limitations of big data. In some areas even Google has decided that a small sample size delivers the information necessary to make a sufficiently informed decision.E-commerce, recommender systems, targeted advertising and pay per click advertising are described in the book. How Amazon uses big data finds its place in the book as well.If you have an interest in any of these topics, I recommend the book highly. Some of the examples in the book, while simply, required me to consider them carefully, but I thought the effort was worthwhile. You may find the effort worthwhile as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Big Data: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)

"ConclusionThis book aims to introduce the general audience to Big Data, and succeeds. The book is easy to read, interesting, detailed, wide-ranging, and not a single word is wasted. Hopefully it will give you some ideas on how Big Data might be useful for your own work.If you come from a programming background, you might be disappointed in the content, however this is not a Big Data programming book (there are many of these, please see ""Reading Your Way Into Big Data"" for further info). On my initial read (several months ago) I was a little disappointed, I was expecting a more technical book, with an emphasis on distributed processing, Hadoop and Spark. However, the fault lies with me – this book is for the general reader.I have a small confession… I absolutely love this series of books, they are aimed at taking you from no real knowledge of the topic to perhaps first year undergraduate level. There are currently around 625 books in the series (a few more are added each month). I have around 100 of them, with about 70 still to read. They cover a diverse range of topics, including:*Arts and Humanities*Dictionaries and Reference*Law*Medicine and Health*Science and Mathematics*Social SciencesI would encourage to explore the series website.There is, of course, a lot more to say about Big Data, but this book covers a lot of ground in only 112 packed pages. If you would like a general and interesting introduction to Big Data, what it is, how its used, together with some real social issues, I highly recommend this small book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Big Data: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)

Very grateful for his work.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Self-Taught Computer Scientist: The Beginners Guide to Data Structures & Algorithms
"I originally recommended this book for beginners in my review. I had read a few early sections that seemed ok. I’ve become more disappointed as I keep reading.A great example is the chapter on heaps. He confuses the definition with one specific application of a heap when he defines it as “a tree based structure on which each node keeps track of two pieces of information: a value and its priority.” By using such a narrow definition, I’m afraid the generality of this structure and its other applications could be lost to the reader.Wikipedia offers a much better definition: a “tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C.”What’s more, after walking the reader through a visual example of how items are ordered in a heap, he never provides any code to implement one. Instead, he shows how to use Python’s built in library. Since this book is supposed to be for “self taught computer scientists” and not “self taught Python coders,” this seems to be an egregious oversight.It would also be helpful if the author would describe why algorithms work the way they do instead of simply providing solutions. The book feels very much like an answer key instead of a textbook. Complexities are simply provided without explanation.Additionally, I’ve found a number of typos throughout the book. Overall, the book comes across as a rough draft that was published with no peer review or critique from peers.While there’s certainly some value here for beginners, I’m hesitant to recommend it because it seems to have a narrow perspective and relies too heavily on Python’s capabilities instead of teaching the underlaying algorithms.I won’t say this couldn’t be helpful to people. It definitely could be the text that provides the key insight someone needs as they’re wrestling with a problem, and it’s a decent overview of basic structures and algorithms. But it’s more of a jumping off point to go find what topics you need to learn.",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Self-Taught Computer Scientist: The Beginners Guide to Data Structures & Algorithms

"I have over 20 years writing code and working IT.I often search for good books to help beginners learn more advanced concepts.This is not a very good book for learning computer science.There are a few reasons why it is not very good.1 - It's a lot of words where the author (who seems confused by many of the subjects himself) seems to work himself up into explaining what the concept is.2 - It's not a great map (or path) for learning Computer Science.  It doesn't really tell the story, working from one concept to the next smoothly. It kind of jumps around.  Jumps onto a subject, kind of tries to explain it then jumps off onto the next subject.

"Power BI beginner books are tricky.  Since the program is updated by Microsoft almost every month, content can quickly become outdated.  Greg Deckler has taken a very smart approach to making this book as ""evergreen"" as possible.  First, he has clearly updated all of the content in this book to capture the newest elements in Power BI.  Second, and more importantly, he does an outstanding job explaining the *key concepts* relevant to each section, then following up with a summary, questions and a recommended list of further reading materials.  Thus, even if the specific ""click here, insert this"" steps change over time, this book will remain a very valuable resource.Greg is one of my favorite Power BI authors.  He has a tremendous breadth and depth of Power BI knowledge, explains complex concepts in a clear and intuitive way, but also always takes a unique and creative approach to his subject matter.  In this book, he has included topics I've never seen addressed in any Power BI book, much less a beginner's guide.  Rather than jumping right into the Power BI how-to's, an early chapter of this book focuses on properly planning Power BI projects, from identifying stakeholders, goals and requirements to discussing the different team roles required - content that I think would benefit even many experienced Power BI users.Similarly, at the end of the book, he provides an insightful exploration of the current BI job market including a detailed breakdown of the typical responsibilities, requirements and even salaries of different BI-related jobs, and practical BI-specific career advice, e.g., interview strategies and how to negotiate salary and benefits.For any Power BI beginner looking to quickly become a highly proficient, well-rounded practitioner, I would give this book my highest recommendation.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Power BI: A comprehensive step--step guide for beginners to learn real-world business intelligence 2nd Edition

"I bought the Kindle version of this book a few days ago when it had been discounted. While I had read some books on data science before and have a somewhat solid understanding of statistics, I thought that this book might be a refreshing departure of the more dry texts based on the overall positive reviews.Sadly, this wasn't so. Admittedly, I only made it through the first 25% of the book before I couldn't get myself to continue. I found myself spending more time marking up mistakes in the book than actually reading. Even the simplest of concepts like singular value decomposition (SVD) is full of errors; matrices are being called vectors, the order of matrix multiplication is displayed incorrectly, etc.Everybody makes mistakes, and this wouldn't be such a deal breaker if the rest of the book up to here contained useful information. To put it in terms of data science, if you had to perform data reduction on Part I of the book, the eigenvalue would be zero, yet this would be a good predictor for the next 5%. There's absolutely nothing in the first part that would be worth keeping if I was the technical editor.

I am a complete novice when it comes to data science.  Most of the material left me more or less confused.  The worst part of the book was the author's discussion on Python.  As someone who is a Python expert she didn't do justice to her chapter on that subject as far as I am concerned.  Lots of definitions and then the snippets of coding examples were too confusing.

Very useful for beginner and intermediate programmers and those who want to create a solid foundation.Now not only FAANG and the tech giants companies ask questions about data structure and algorithms but small and startup companies use the same strategy and 90% of people fail, because of insufficiency of a solid foundation on the topic. This book replenishes that space and makes you more confident in a fun way.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to make a foundation on DA&A and I will keep this book in my library forever.This book would have been more advantageous if the author had counted more problems to solve.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Python: Store manipulate and access data effectively and boost the performance of your applications 3rd Edition

"As a CS student I consider myself well versed on Data Structures and Algorithms and this book covers all the top ones you will learn as a student. It goes over many of Pythons built in collections, and covers things like Greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and even covers time and space complexity showing you how to apply basic principles to better understand how each algorithm may be functioning.I followed along and implemented each of the Data Structs as well as all the algorithms in the book and had a great time doing it. You get to learn all about singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, as well as Stacks and Queues, Heaps and Priority Queues, different Trees and much more. What was great was that all the examples worked perfectly!Also, I really enjoyed how easy this book was to read. I had a tough time putting it down, it kept me wanting to implement the next DS or Algorithm and that is not easy to pull off as many technical books on the subject are dry and difficult to follow.I have never read the earlier editions, so I am not sure what is new it this edition, but as for the third edition it really covers a ton of material. It was missing a little though such as implementing Trie Data Structures which would have fit nicely in the section on Trees. It also lacked any real projects, which I feel would have been nice to help apply the data structures and algorithms to some real-world examples. It did have simple test cases of course but that is not the same as building an actual project using the stuff we learned.All in all, the book is excellent and is very fun to read. I’d recommend it for beginners on the subject, as well it could be a nice refresher for anyone with more advanced knowledge on the subject.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Python: Store manipulate and access data effectively and boost the performance of your applications 3rd Edition

"I purchased this book to help me with my final projects for a data science bootcamp because the curriculum didn’t go deep enough into time series for me. Sadly, it was money - and time- wasted.I have three main issues:- A significant part of the short text is spent telling me what you’re going to tell me or going off on tangents about other ML algorithms that are not related to time series.- The audience is unclear. Terms such as feature vector, tensor and hyperparameter are assumed to be understood (which feels appropriate), but then they are followed up by a definition of median. I found myself alternating between skipping several pages of material and looking up critical missing information (see gripe 3).- Critical information is missing. The four components of stationarity are mentioned, but the text never addresses how to correct for these. When a SARIMAX model is introduced, the values for order and seasonal order are just thrown in with no discussion of how to determine these. If I hadn’t already had exposure to that, I would have been clueless where they came from. I was hoping to learn how & when to incorporate exogenous variables, but that was never discussed in any depth. Overall, the “why” was missing, which is way more important than the actual statmodels code snippets.I have a few pages bookmarked and a few entries highlighted, but overall, I’m back to StackOverflow and Machine Learning Mastery for help.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning for Time Series Forecasting with Python
The author's knowledge of the subject of time series is very deep and the explanations given shown in a simple manner exemplify the approach.

I would highly recommend this book for people wanting to learn and get better in time series analysis.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning for Time Series Forecasting with Python
"The book has very good concepts about time analysis, but It doesn't have many real case examples, it just relies on measuring temperature, it doesn't explain how to interpret graph,  Finally, some sample codes were misspelled in the book and it was hard to interpret so it became super difficult for me to use azure services correctly.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning for Time Series Forecasting with Python
"I'm new to using machine learning for forecasting, but I used machine learning in other areas throughout my recent career. I think this book is an ideal introduction to forecasting: all the examples are clear and meaningful (actionable in real life).

It was a great Christmas 2020 read! : )",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning for Time Series Forecasting with Python
"The structure of the book is good but the content insufficiently covers the material and presents little more than a shallow introduction.For example, how can one discuss time series forecasting of power loads without discussing weekends, holidays, anomalies, etc. Simply fitting hello world examples from the statstools library and slapping on a 40$ price tag is not enough.An overpriced title in my opinion, but good if you're looking for an introduction to time series forecasting and immediate deployment strategies to Azure.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning for Time Series Forecasting with Python

"Even though the author holds a Ph.D in Computer Science, she is more on the industry side. This book is basically a combination of a toy example on an energy dataset and an introduction to Microsoft Azure ML.Overall, I think this book is still in MVP phase. You are not going to totally waste time and money on it, but it could have been much much better.I appreciate that the authors introduce some great packages such as statsmodels that data scientists do not use as often as Pandas, Numpy, sklearn.But I feel the chapters are not strictly connected and the book is not well organized. For example, in Chapter 4, the author spends 80% of the pages introducing AR, MA, ARIMA and even SARIMAX. I was expecting the author to discuss more on how to determine the parameters such as p, d, q, P, D, Q, s for SARIMAX, but suddenly she jumped to Azure AutoARIMA. I see a big disconnection over here. IMO, the author could have just spend 10% inroducing these models and then bring up AutoML.Another issue in the book is that there are typos and mistakes. Even the notebook would not run. For example, in the Automated Machine Learning notebook for Chapter 4, the author never defined ws before using it. Also, in the book, the author should at least show a couple of screenshots of the notebook's result.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning for Time Series Forecasting with Python

"So far I've only made it to ""for loops"" chapter 4; but I think this is a really good book. I had an online class from a local University and this book has covered somethings that the class did not. Not that what the book covered and the class didn't has been major; but is interesting that only having reached chapter 4 in the book that there are things the class left out. So far the biggest change between this book and the class I took is that the book does a much better job of explaining for loops. I even watched a video on Youtube to teach you Python with no experience and even that did not do as good a job of explaining why a for loop is written the way it is. Being that the class I took was online and was one of those classes done in half the time (warp speed) I didn't bother to ask why a for loop is written the way it is I just wrote it and followed the class examples (and yes I passed the class with an A but Python is not my first programming language). I feel way more confident in learning Python after the book did such a good job of explaining for loops that as I continue with the book I believe it will explain things better then the class I took or the video I watched. On a side note the class I took, as all college classes I have taken do, required a book and that book just didn't do a good job of explaining for loops (go figure). You might be wondering why am I using this book if I took an online class and the answer is it has been awhile since I took that class so I need a refresher. Also the college that I took that class from doesn't offer another a following Python class to take unless you sign up for a degree program (and I already have a degree I just want to become proficient in Python). I would recommend that if you want to learn Python to use in a job to take at least one class from a college or another way to get proof that you learned Python other than studying it on your own. Also another reason to learn from a book with no class attached to it is you can learn at your own pace. Now I could learn from the book that I bought for the college course since the class only went so far into the book; but I just didn't find that book to be very well written and full of information one doesn't really need to learn how to program with Python. I feel like a ""college"" course book has a lot of bloat while a book like this one is more straight forward. A book like this one survives and sells or not because it is good etc while a college course book is chosen by the teacher or school regardless of the reviews it got. So after this extremely long review I would recommend this book; but I think one does need something (a class, certificate etc) to show proof that one has at least some Python knowledge outside of ones own studying.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Crash Course 2nd Edition: A Hands-On Project-Based Introduction to Programming

"Mesh advances the analytics domain in ways I'd not considered, but should have. My career has been in technology in small-cap public companies, and historically I've embraced the notion of a centralized analytics team creating and supporting: data pipelines, ELT/ETL, data lake, data marts, etc. Mesh blows up this mental model in favor of decentralized data elements surfaced via API's, and closer to their domain ownership.Dehghani posits a product model for analytic data, where functional teams surface data from operational systems, microservices, etc. directly. No longer reliant on a central team to provide a single source of truth; Rather, they expose data in a more raw form (my words), servicing both their own domain as well as others through defined data ports. She suggests leveraging developers for this work, avoiding the challenge of attracting and retaining resources in the analytics domain (data architects, etc.). Dehghani uses examples from a fictitious streaming music service that seems to mirror Spotify.There's certainly much more, and I recommend Data Mesh to anyone in a technology role. While I applaud her vision, and agree, directionally, with Mesh, there are three areas that I struggled with.First, the Mesh model seems much better suited to a larger tech company such as an Apple, Amazon, Spotify, etc. In my experience, SMB's just don't have the budget/headcount to support the expansive vision that Mesh espouses.Second, Mesh leans heavily toward ""states rights"" and away from central control. The success of this model hinges on knowledgeable, talented technical resources willingly collaborating for a greater good. That, in turn, presumes the existence/extension of global standards, the right culture of adherence to standards, adequate resources to serve the greater good (supporting deprecated API's for the benefit of other domains, for example), etc. In my experience, when the going gets tough, functions/domains tend to become more self-serving.Third, the vision of Mesh is fantastic, and fantastically broad. With data governance and privacy controlled through code. Consistent documentation, both human and computer, available for all data objects. Eschewing data lakes, warehouses, marts in favor of joins across domain API's (again, my words). Although Dehghani seeks to avoid monolithic solutions, I had to wonder if that isn't exactly where a fully-realized Mesh infrastructure ends up.Data Mesh is a bit redundant in pushing its vision for decentralization. It reads very much like a graduate software engineering text, with many references (many are excellent). Overall, very well written and a compelling vision that aligns perfectly with a microservices strategy, digital transformation and a product focus. Although it would be counter to Dehghani's specific vision of avoiding monolithic solutions, I have to wonder if a younger analytics company like Snowflake will try to run with it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mesh: Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale
"This book is the missing manual. If you're in any data driven organization &/or managing an organization through a transformation with the goal to manage distributed data as products, this is a must read.The book is technology agnostic. What it does very well is lay out a very thorough map for what shape data, technologies & teams should look like, what functions they should fulfill & how they should all interoperate as a system to manage data as product successfully. It provides a somewhat idealized vision, but I'm all in as I've seen some of this in action & helped put some of these systems in place.At MarkLogic we helped organizations implement solutions that managed data as product. (I no longer work at MarkLogic & have nothing to gain here in promoting them, just sharing my experience.) MarkLogic integrated data from various silos within large organizations to create data products. Above the silos of data were silos of people that also required integrating. Change management was always a challenge. I recommend How Stella Saved the Farm & The Phoenix Project to help others start to understand the types of changes they need to embrace to succeed. But what was missing was the architectural guide. We made up for it with slides, white papers & tribal knowledge, but this Data Mesh book truly captures some of the best practices I saw organziations put into place.It's all here: start with the business goal and work your way back, data product as self-contained unit, the sidecar pattern, embedding policy as code, start small & fast for a big win, iterate, progressively enhance products, govern with provenance & lineage, the changing roles that support this endeavor, operational & analytical systems & the desired intertwingling, + more..We didn't use the term Data Mesh & didn't do everything captured here. The challenge with any vendor is we tend to think of ourselves as the center of the universe. MarkLogic's way to integrate with a larger world of data was Semantics. But #DataMesh provides a higher level of abstraction.The book's just really well done. Technology vendors don't know how to document like this. Vendors focus on their own product's knobs & levers. What they fail to understand & illustrate for their customers is that their particular technology works within a system of technologies to achieve a business goal. It never works alone. So I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book. If you can grok the patterns outlined here, you can fill in the gaps with the technology, people & process right for your solution.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mesh: Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale
"Zhamak Dehghani says “Data mesh is what comes after an inflection point, shifting our approach, attitude, and technology toward data. Mathematically, an inflection point is a magic moment at which a curve stops bending one way and starts curving in the other direction. It’s a point that the old picture dissolves, giving way to a new one.” Data Mesh, Chapter 6“A strategic inflection point is a time in the life of a business when its fundamentals are about to change. That change can mean an opportunity to rise to new heights. But it may just as likely signal the beginning of the end. — Andrew S. Grove” Data Mesh, Chapter 6In the Data Mesh book, Zhamak Dehghani does not refer only to the real world practices that reinforce the data mesh theory, but also stands on the generally accepted principles of Systems Thinking. Zhamak Dehghani referred to “Thinking in Systems” for Donnelly H. Meadows while talking about leverage points and feedback loops for maintaining Dynamic Equilibrium.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mesh: Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale

If I could offer a criticism, I would ask to her to use language that is plain to the average data professional. However, it is digestible, especially if you take 3 or 4 chapters at a time.

"This is definitely an intro book - it's not poorly written but also not the best on the subject.It uses R, which is an open-source, free statistical software - which is great - but R has some nuances that can be difficult to pick up, and those are not really covered here. As a practicing erstwhile data scientist, it's really hard to leave out statistics from the work (without fully understanding the data, the biases in the data collection and reporting, what's missing and what's an outlier: valid or not?) people can make some really misleading and wrong conclusions while exploring data in the name of ""data science."" So it would be good for some practical tips of how to approach new datasets for exploration, recognizing that not all datasets are going to be cleaned and curated for the data scientist. Having recently mentored a student who didn't know how to recode variables, that's a key component that should also be covered. It would improve also by following some of the O'Reilly format approaches for presenting code in a textbook.So expect to dip toes into the water but this book is very solidly in the shallow end of data understanding, exploration, and data science.",4.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Data Science
"This is a nicely written book for beginners who want to learn about data science.  When I say beginners I mean a smart high school upperclassman.  The writing is not mathematically challenging and the examples are easy to follow.  That said, the content left me scratching my head.  The problem was not that the writing was bad or the topics were hard but rather I don't know why the authors included it.  For example, early on the authors talk about binary representation.  That is sorta-kinda useful but not as a core feature for a data scientist.  Other oddities include the coverage of the central limit theorem and law of large numbers.  I teach university level data science and biostatistics and I thought the explanation was nicely done but again I found myself thinking why are they taking the space to cover this as the core part of a book on data science.  There are many interesting chapters (like the coverage of database connections and shiny) but so much of the material is barely an appetizer not even a light snack.  While it is good to make beginners aware of things that can be done, the reader is only able to break the surface of some very deep waters.The code is not bad but it could be better.  The typesetting on the code blocks could use work.  The large font makes it easy to read but the way it wraps makes it rough to study and it causes it to not really conform to the popular R styles (like Google's).  The choice of R packages is okay but it could be better.  In particular, *many* data scientists work extensively with the tidyverse packages and they do data manipulation using dplyr.  While bits of the tidyverse are presented it does not get enough attention and the lack of dplyr support is a very bad oversight.  Basically the code looks closer to 2014/2015 then 2017/2018.If you are a reader starting from zero then this is not a bad buy but if you have any data manipulation experience start with

If you're not a programmer, you'll probably love it. If you are, well my internal dialog went something like, ""@*#(&*$KHUSDFKJ@!!!! Another 'language' to learn!"" Luckily, R is more of an overgrown statistical package than an actual language.This book is short, precise and to the point, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Data Science

"I had been trying to use matplotlib on Pi and Windows Python installations with little success for a few weeks before buying this book.  Also, I had never used Anaconda or Jupyter.  Chap 1 gives great step-by-step guidance for setting up Anaconda, and once that is done all the Python examples work like a charm.  I have both the print  version and ebook.  I enjoy having the print book at hand so that I do not have to switch screens frequently.  I haven't found the code files provided to readers necessary as not much typing is required to enter the examples, and the manual entry process does help to clarify the process and make me attentive to details I would otherwise miss.  A fringe benefit is that I have become comfortable with Anaconda/Jupyter on my Windows computer.One of my goals was to use matplotlib on my Raspberry Pi 3B+.  I had tried before with little success.  After reading a couple of chapters of Data Visualization, I realized that the problem resides in the old Pi operating system.  I upgraded to the newest version of he Pi OS at RaspberryPi.org.  This is the Pi OS that comes with the Rasp Pi 4, but it can also be used by older Pi models.  Then, I used pip or sudo apt-get (can't remember which) to install matplotlib on the Pi.  I was able to run the examples from Data Visualization on Thonny which is the editor included with current version of the Pi OS.  To see the graphs in Thonny I found it was necessary to add the line plt. show() as last line in the examples.  The plt.show() line was not needed when I ran the examples in Jupyter on Windows computer.I am extremely pleased with this book.  It really is pitched to the level of a beginning Python user.

 Recently, I have been studying data visualization based on Python – a common language programming. Thus, I looked for several lesson videos on YouTube and the other physical material, such as books, science magazines. At that time, my friend recommended to me the “Data Visualization with Python for Beginners”.For me, I hate reading books, particularly books related to science so I just often watch the instructions as well as lessons through videos. However, this book changed my view of reading science books because of its interest with valuable knowledge of data visualization before starting the other important processes such as data science, machine learning, data analytics.Besides, this book is divided into 10 chapters including a lot of exercises with keys to practice, and examples that help us to understand easily so far.In the first chapter, readers can learn how to set up the Python environment with Anaconda application needed to run various data visualization. Moreover, the author also describes steps to set up this app in detail with both Windows, MacOS and Linux versions.In the following chapters, the beginners will start to learn and practice the different data visualization libraries, consist of Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn from basic plotting to advanced plotting.In my opinion, if you want to start studying this data visualization using these libraries, this book would be your best choice to read before achieving higher goals in the data science field.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Visualization with Python for Beginners: Visualize Your Data using Pandas Matplotlib and Seaborn (Machine Learning & Data Science for Beginners)

"I was expecting the book to contain at least some hands-on applications, with Python code and formulas. But there is no code, not a single formula, no references (apart from sporadic mentions at the bottom of some page), and the sections are not numbered.

"When I saw the announcement for this book on the O'Reilly website, I knew immediately that I had to get it. My programming background is in C/C++/C# and I've only been using Python for a year or two, and I'm still trying to find my way through all the libraries and packages that are available. The description on the O'Reilly website looked like this book would cover of what is important to me as someone who deals with geospatial data on a daily basis.Unfortunately, my conclusion after reading through the book is that it is quite superficial. Most provided examples are the plotting of data, with little actual analysis being shown.It starts with chapter 1, where map projections are briefly explained - limited to global maps with no mentioning of national grids or EPSG codes (which only appear briefly later on). Chapter 2 is an introduction to QGIS. Chapter 3 introduces PyQGIS, the QGIS Python API. Loading and styling data are explained, but there is only one example that actually does any data processing/analysis: Selecting cities based on distance to a river. The paragraph Addressing the Research Question poses an interesting question, but never actually does the analysis - it just encourages the reader to look at the maps and find patterns. This chapter also uses the term uploading for opening datasets in QGIS, which I find confusing.Chapter 4 discusses Google Earth Engine and how to use it to display data. This chapter promises a decision-tree classification of Landsat data - but this never happens. Chapter 5 talks about OpenStreetMap and actually shows a few useful examples, such as calculating travel times, and some network parameters. Chapter 6 is about the ArcGIS Python API, and once again focuses mostly on displaying data. As ArcGIS is commercial software, I feel that this chapter will be of little use to many people.Chapter 7 is about Geopandas. Geopandas is a spatial extension to Pandas, a very powerful Python package for dealing with tabular data. I would have expected that it shows at least how to read a CSV file of data, convert it to a Geopandas data frame with geometry, and save it - but no, only loading and plotting of existing datasets is shown. In a note it is stated that A normal distribution is when the mean, mode, and median are all the same value. This is plain wrong - yes, in a normal distribution the mean, mode, and median are the same value. But one can think of other distributions for which this is the case, but which are not Gaussian and hence not normal.Chapter 8 is about data cleaning, and briefly shows how to use Geopandas to load shapefiles and create Geodataframes from CSV files - which should be happening in chapter 7. Here's another inaccuracy: it is stated that GeoPandas is a Cartesian coordinate reference system, which means that each point is defined by a pair of numerical coordinates, such as latitude and longitude in our example. This is not what a Cartesian coordinate system is, and a latitude/longitude coordinate system is certainly not a Cartesian coordinate system!Chapter 9 is a short introduction to GDAL, a library for working with raster data. Finally, chapter 10 does some real data analysis, using deforestation data. Sorely missing is a chapter about PostGIS, the open source spatial database based upon PostgreSQL.You probably can tell that I'm disappointed by this book. It just feels incomplete and unpolished, and probably should have been called An Introduction to Geospatial Data Analysis with Python or something similar instead. As such, it is useful in providing an overview of packages and possibilities for reading, displaying, and analyzing gespatial data with Python. But for actually learning how to do geospatial analysis with Python, you'll have to go looking elsewhere.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Geospatial Data Analysis: Theory Tools and Practice for Location Intelligence

"Almost every statistical literature I've seen that has any mention of bayesian analysis references this book. This is what brought me into finally purchasing a copy and reading it almost cover to cover.First I want to comment on the bayesian vs frequentist debate, and why one may want to use bayesian methods. Anyone who objects to bayesian paradigm on the basis of subjectivity has to realize that all statistical models are subjective. The decision to use a linear model, logistic regression, or normal distribution for your data, to list a few examples, are subjective decisions. It's no more subjective than putting a prior on your parameters. A prior doesn't have to be very informative, but can encode reasonable range of values for the parameters, such as person's height is between 0 and 10 feet, or that the number of siblings is less than 100, rather than having data completely determine the parameters. When properly incorporated, prior knowledge will help produce more precise parameter estimates.However Bayesian analysis is more than just incorporating prior knowledge into your models. It provides probability distributions on the parameters, instead of asymptotic interval estimates. It provides an automatic way of doing regularization, without a need for cross validation. This allows one to estimate more parameters than classical frequentist models can handle, and even deal with cases when p >= n. Another advantage is relaxing independence and identical distribution assumption, as hierarchical bayesian models automatically build dependence between observations, similar to latent variables in classical statistics.So in my opinion classical statistics already incorporates bayesian ideas through subjective selection of parametric models, practice of regularization such as ridge regression and lasso, and dependence through latent variable models, although it's done in somewhat ad-hoc manner. Bayesian statistics formalizes these notions within probability theory, and together with simulation, allows easy extensions of them in various non-trivial directions.Now about this book. It covers all these advantages of bayesian methods and more, although sometimes requires considerable effort from the reader to uncover and pull out the relevant concepts. It's definitely not meant to be an introduction to statistics. It's assumed the reader is well versed in classical statistics and has a good grasp on topics such as hypothesis testing and interval estimation, sufficient statistics and the exponential family, MLE and it's asymptotic properties, EM algorithm, and generalized linear models, to name a few. Also I think that bayesian methods require a deeper intuition in probability theory and involve more computation and approximation techniques to build even simple models. Considering the background needed it's likely that the reader would have had a considerable prior exposure to bayesian techniques, and I think this is the target audience that the authors had in mind when writing this book.The book is definitely tough on the first reading, especially if this is your first book entirely devoted to this subject. But reading it is well worth the effort. It covers a lot of details and subtleties of bayesian approach that are not well emphasized in books devoted to general statistics and machine learning.The book is of applied nature, written in a way that every applied book should be. There is enough discussion of the theory in order to understand, apply, and extend the described methods. Each chapter is followed by a small section discussing the relevant references if you need to follow the theory in more detail. The authors make a great use of non-trivial examples that show the implementation details and possible complications in the discussed models. In addition, there's an appendix covering computations with R and Stan software.The first five chapters present a solid, if somewhat terse, introduction to general bayesian methods, including asymptotics and connection to MLE, and culminating in hierarchical bayesian models in chapter 5. Two chapters follow on the important topic of model testing and selection. Chapter 8 covers data collection, and while it's a fascinating read and a novel idea if you've never seen it before, I think it could be skipped on the first reading without affecting much the understanding of further chapters.Chapters 10-13 deal with simulation and analytic approximations, two central tools for bayesian analysis, because for most practical models direct analytic expressions are intractable. The authors provide a good overview of the rejection sampling, Gibbs, and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. The explanations are enough for basic implementations. Chapter 13 introduces approximations around posterior modes. There is a very intuitive explanation of the EM algorithm along with it's mathematical derivation. This is followed by variational inference and expectation propagation, approximations which are based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence.Up to this point in the book is a solid overview of bayesian inference, model checking, simulation and approximation techniques. Further chapters are mixed in the level of presentation and content.The second half of the book deals with regression. The chapters here become terser and the language less precise. The level of presentation deteriorates towards the end, where in my opinion the chapters on non-parametric models are almost impossible to understand without some prior exposure. There are more sections that require multiple re-readings and places where I feel reading the references prior to the book is a good idea (such as dirichlet processes). However I do think that the chapters on robust inference and finite mixture models were exceptionally good.I was disappointed that only 2 pages were devoted to regularization and variable selection in linear regression. In my opinion bayesian techniques provide powerful alternatives to classical regularization methods, where instead of choosing the regularization hyperparameters through cross validation, we marginalize over it, thus effectively taking an average over all possible regularizations. Although authors do spend more time on regularization in the context of the basis function selection in chapter 20, I feel it's a pity they didn't choose to devote more space to it in linear regression setting.Some other small negative things about the book in my opinion are:  - constantly referring to later chapters in the book  - various small typos/mistakes that detract from reading  - presentation of expectation propagation in chapter 13 is confusing and no mention is made that it's related to minimizng Kullback-Leibler divergence  - no mention of relevance vector machines for basis function selection in chapter 20  - no mention of bayesian dimensionality reduction and factor modelsHowever I think that the excellent presentation in the first half of the book alone makes it well worth studying. It's use as a reference far outweighs it's shortcomings as an introduction, and I'm sure I'll be picking it up countless times when reading other bayesian material. I highly recommend this book for anyone with classical statistics background looking to understand bayesian methods in depth.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Data Analysis (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)
"Best introduction to the subject, even after a decade since its last edition.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Data Analysis (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)
"My impression from people around me was that this book is the canonical textbook for those who want to get into Bayesian statistics. After having read this book from cover to cover, however, I do not think it is a good idea to start learning Bayesian statistics with this book, as it covers very wide range of topics and therefore does not get into much technical depth for most of them. I think this book is ideal for someone like me who has very basic understanding of Bayesian statistics but would like to get some exposure to variety of existing tools in the literature so that when some of them become needed at certain point of my career, I can reopen this book and follow its references to learn enough to actually use them.The stance of this book is very practical, and it is great to get a glimpse of how these grand-master Statisticians approach data analysis. First few chapters regarding the underlying philosophy of Bayesian statistics is also brilliantly written, a must-read for any Statistician.I was somewhat disappointed with changes in the third edition though. The addition of Gaussian Processes and other advanced topics is greatly advertised, but I found these new chapters to be relatively poorly written compared to those in the previous edition; notations are not consistent with previous chapters, and clarity of writing is disappeared. It was a stupid idea to buy the new edition while having the second edition.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Data Analysis (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)

The coding example Appendix C has also been reworked to use Stan rather than BUGS.The physical layout of the book has been improved as well. It's the same thickness, but slightly larger in the other two dimensions and with a smaller bottom margin, which I think gives a much better amount of information per page.

"The text in this book seems overtly redundant/irrelevant; many details (words, sentences, even paragraphs) can be dropped without affecting the content.

This is a text book, not a paper, what's the point of enforcing accuracy in details and suppress derivation of equations. As a reader who wish to learn instead of to judge the content, such writing style only induces unnecessary headache. Might as well read the papers.This is at least the impression I get from the introduction and the first chapter. The process was already slow and tedious, and in the end there were only a handful of points that are noteworthy. Seeing that the style doesn't seem to barge for the rest of the chapters, even ones that describe the algorithms, I don't think I will regret dropping the book.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Data Analysis (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)

It’s a thorough book on how to download data from websites into python and how to visualize the data in a tabular display or graphical using typical add-on libraries such a Panda and Seaborn.  Unlike some other books on data analysis with Python, the explanations of how to perform data analysis are thorough rather than terse or with no explanations.The book also shows the use of the Python development interface Juypter Notebooks, which allows you to execute Python statements individually without the use of a debugger, so it’s a simple way to work through the examples one at a time.

If you are a starting or seasoned developer going through gut-wrenching process of preparing for the current tech interview process this is probably one of the best resources in terms of letting you know that your experience or inexperience doesn't matter as long as you can solve the problems in this book.  The author amusingly states that the interviewers are trying to see how you approach problems that 'you've never seen before' and then shows you 189 of the most common ones.  It is significantly likely that although your coding interview with a FAANG-like company may not have of these problems exactly it will be some flavor of one or more of them.  You will also likely have to solve them under time constraints that will likely not allow you to think through them as if you had never seen them before while the interviewer is waiting for your answer so repetitive practice is key.  Know that your competition for these interviews could be spending hundreds of hours practicing the types of problems in this book while you may be doing useful work so you may have to take significant time out of your schedule to practice to be competitive.  What that says about those who have successfully or unsuccessfully navigated the tech interview process is unclear.  I suppose the idea is for technology companies to have a consistent interview process although a consistently bad interview process may miss more candidates than an inconsistently good one.  But this is the system we are currently stuck with so I guess that you should play along until the tech companies evolve and a better technical interview process comes along.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions

"I’ve been meaning to review this book for a while. Last year I got laid off from my startup and found myself feeling anxious as I haven’t had to look for a job for several years. I bought this book along with two others, but this was the only one I really spent time on. The first third of this book provides specific information about companies along with example problems. The last two thirds are problem solutions with explanations. I found everything valuable. I didn’t write out complete solutions for most of her example problems. If I thought it was obvious I skipped it, but whatever you do don’t skip reading the solution. It’s here where you can read about ways of solving the problem that didn’t occur to you. For example, if you want to know if two binary trees are identical you can verify this by comparing their preorder and inorder traversals. The only gaps were discrete math and heaps. Heaps appeared frequently in sample questions on Glassdoor. I pulled an old data structures book out to re-read about heaps, but I was never explicitly asked about them during my job search though I did mention them a couple times as possible ways to maintain a priority queue.Information about the companies was very relevant as I live in the Bay Area. I wish I had heeded her admonition about discrete math for Google because I was unprepared for these questions. I would have read the math if it was in the book, but since I haven’t used that math ever in a job I skipped it. During the interview I was able to solve the math problems except I needed basic definitions and one or two hints. For Amazon it was good to know there’s a “bar raiser” because it was obvious when I met the interviewer who wrote out a really hard problem right off the bat and wanted a linear time algorithm. I was speechless for five minutes, but managed to reduce the problem enough where the solution suddenly came to me. I think I would have been unnerved by the question if I didn’t know about this type of interviewer that she writes about. I wish she also covered Twitter and LinkedIn.The book doesn’t talk enough about applying for jobs. I do wish she wrote about job offer contingencies as my first job offer was from a startup who told me it expires in 24 hours. This in turn caused other recruiters to panic. While in the end I got a good job, all in all I hope I’m not forced to do this again anytime soon. I’m just glad I had this book at my side. It was indispensable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions
"First, I have no idea why Silicon Valley is obsessed with these interviews. Is it just that they couldn't figure anything else out? These questions are a terrible indicator of how good of a programmer you are. My software company, outside the valley, has interviews that actually relate to the job, and we get confused candidates because they've practiced all these algorithm and data structure problems and little else. Anyway, it's what we have and that's what the book is geared towards. It's a decent book. I like to have an ""offline"" thing to supplement my online training, and this fills that void. Unfortunately, it's not without its flaws. It needs a bit of a math review of the commutative property and logs, otherwise understanding that chapter is going to be difficult. It has an occasional ""easily proved"" or ""easily disproved"" type of verbiage which is never backed up. (This is something I see in far too many books.) The biggest flaw of the book is you can't ask clarifying questions about a problem, which you will most definitely need to do at an interview. That's more of a flaw of the format rather than the author. I'm not going to go into details of each of the problems, because I don't want to give anything away, but I remember doing the first problem and wondering why in the world they were suggesting doing a quicksort or other n log n algorithm on a string which is at most 26 characters.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions

"The main reason I bought the book is that it closely reflects the status quo of the technical interviews in large tech companies. You probably can do 1000 problems on leetcode in several months and achieve better results. But this book can be done in maybe half of the time and yet does a decent sampling of the typical problems.I have both the 5th edition and the 6th edition. I bought 2 editions because the 6th edition has more problems and is better organized.Four stars instead of five for two reasons.First is about what the book is promoting. The current interview process is far from being perfect. For many of the problems, unless you know the solutions beforehand, there is no way you can code up a decent one within an hour. Some of the problems were even research subjects for years before an optimal solution was found. The book mentions an example, a good candidate whom the author knows very well but just cannot pass the coding interviews. As the author explains, large tech companies can afford false negatives. How to fix the problem? Read the book back and forth and do the problems several times. Then a candidate will greatly increase the chance of landing a good job. But the question is: Will anyone who aces on interview problems necessarily perform well on the job? Will this person necessarily be a good engineer? I do not know. There are definitely false positives too. I am guessing the assumption is that the coding problems we do nowadays on the interviews somehow achieve minimal number of false positives. But I doubt there are actually numbers supporting that claim.The second reason for a star less is the lack of rigorousness. Some of the problems are presented unclear. I have to go to the solution part to figure out what a problem actually means. Some of the solutions are not straightforward. For example, there is a problem calls for topological sort. However, none of the solutions given uses breadth-first search. Why? Some of the solutions have wrong analysis. For example, the subtree checking problem. One solution reduces the problem to checking for substrings. The Java method is String.indexOf(). The author claims the time complexity is O(m+n), which I believe for Java is actually O(mn).Overall this is good book for preparing for coding interviews.

The publisher should put out a second edition with updates, and knock the price down a few bucks.

"An experienced developer should be able to work around the typos/errors, assuming the poor English doesn't drive you crazy.I've been away from serious coding for over a decade & ordered the book to get my feet wet again - to ease back into development.  I received this book a few days ago and worked my way through the first of five manuscripts in about 4 hours.  It appears to be written by a non-native English speaker.  It's pretty clunky, but that doesn't bother me too much as I work with many super sharp developers who don't speak great English.What's truly frustrating is that several written examples are poorly written or otherwise confusing and there are coding examples that simply do not work as described (or will raise interpreter errors).  Again - I've only worked through the first manuscript so far, but I've experienced at least a dozen errors in the text  that would likely stop a true beginner in their tracks.I admittedly bought it over the more popular publishers to save $$$.

"Renowned AI pioneer and Nobel laureate Herbert Simon underscored ‘attention’ as the most valuable resource of information economy, as necessary to allocate attention efficiently among the overabundance of information resources. Having written the foundational paper on meaning-aware AI and recently having served as MIT-Princeton-USASF-AFRL AI Faculty-SME, I had the privilege of publishing by invitation in the same journal’s special issue of ASQ, the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award administrator as well as guiding the Malcolm Bridge Awarded corporate CxOs for the Conference Board US Quality Council at the invitation of the Florida Power & Light Company Chief Quality Officer. In addition, I have been ranked along with Simon in the same global academic citation impact studies.Given above background, I am thrilled to share with you the most thorough and up-to-date compendium of research, practices, case studies, and applications available today that can provide the best ROI on the latest AI technological advances on transformers inspired by the paper, “Attention is All You Need.” Since Google introduced transformer architecture in 2017, transformers have provided exponential improvements in context-focused realization toward meaning-aware AI as deep (neural network) learning models based upon attention mechanisms such as dot-product attention and multi-head attention. Resulting advances in enhanced parallel processing of sequential data have made efficient context-sensitive and hence more “meaningful” for ever-larger datasets and much more feasible than earlier.Covering the latest advances in neural network architectures related to transformers spanning applications such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series analysis, and computer vision and domain-specific models spanning science, medicine, and finance, the book aims to meet the theoretical, research, application, and practical needs across academia and industry for multiple audiences including  postgraduate students and researchers, undergraduate students, industry practitioners, and professionals. The book rounds off its theory-driven applied and practical coverage with hands-on case studies with focus on AI explainability, an increasingly important theme in practice imposed by greater focus on issues such as ethical AI and trustable AI.- Dr. Yogesh Malhotra, Founding Chairman and CEO, New York State Global Venture Capital and Private Equity Firm, Global Risk Management Network LLC, R&D Impact Ranked Among Artificial Intelligence and Quantitative Finance Nobel Laureates such as Herbert Simon and Black-Scholes – AACSB-ASIS&T, Editorial-Review Boards of the National Science Foundation and Top-50 Global Scientific-STEM & Computer Science & AI Research Journals & Publishers.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Transformers for Machine Learning: A Deep Dive (Chapman & Hall/CRC Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition)

"(Background: I read an early review copy of this. It's an update to previous editions. I haven't read those earlier editions and evaluated this as a standalone work. This is an end-user book, not aimed at developers or administrators of Tableau systems.)This book starts with the basics and slowly builds up to fairly sophisticated techniques for doing visualizations using Tableau. If you are a Tableau beginner, this is a great way to learn to use it at your own pace. If you already have some Tableau experience, I'll bet there will be things in here that are either new to you or that you have kind of forgotten about. I know that was true for me.If you are a beginner, I recommend that you stay in Chapter 1 until you feel completely comfortable with all the things he describes in that introduction. Like pretty much any sophisticated tool, there is some terminology that you will find it best to have burned into your brain cells to make the rest of the material easier to take in. Not that it's hard; it's just that it may be new ground for you, and you don't want to be bothered with trying to remember that sort of stuff when you are really trying to digest some larger concept. He does a good job of explaining what you need to know for the rest of the book, so don't skip it thinking it's a lightweight introduction.One of the things I like best about this book, besides its thorough coverage of the topic, is that the author goes beyond merely explaining how to do various things. He explains why you would or would not make various choices. This is the creative part of storytelling with data, and he's interested in having you accomplish your storytelling goals rather than just presenting visual facts from the data.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning Tableau 2022
"Josh Milligan’s Learning Tableau 2022, 5th edition is a great read. Josh has written this book for an absolute beginner, so a full introduction to the interface and all menus/options is covered.  Josh explains all the fundamentals in the first half of the book with step-by-step follow along instructions, in the context of thinking like a data professional.  More importantly, his explanations of the behind the scenes processes internal to Tableau are straightforward and make learning how to use this incredible package much smoother.Intermediate and some advanced topics are explained and demonstrated.  The latest additions to Tableau are covered.  I really enjoyed the explanations of fundamental topics like data types (dimensions vs. measures and discrete vs. continuous) and LOD (Level of Detail) calculations. The dashboard created in chapter 8 has quite a bit of end user functionality.  Josh does a great job with custom calculations, filters and parameters.I have only read and worked through the first half, and looking forward to learning more about dynamic dashboards, adding extensions, and even Tableau Prep.

"While I have not read this book in full, the logical flow from one topic to the next not only increases in complexity, as one would expect, but it follows a logical learning curve. Most users begin with the basics of the Tableau Desktop interface and create some basic charts, creating calculations to enhance their analysis, building dashboards and formatting their visuals, and even going back to make changes to their data model. While some of the data modeling chapters come towards the end of the book, which can feel like the opposite of the natural order, it is critical to understand what is possible with Tableau Desktop before curating a data source. There is a whole chapter dedicated to maps and another to extensions, scripts, and Tableau CRM. This book even covers Tableau Prep, which helps to prepare unruly data sets.

"I'm the ""tech guy"" for a startup -- we need something done/built, but don't have anyone who knows how to do it? Yep, that means I'll be doing it...Knowing *nothing* about dimensional modeling, I was asked to lead the team that's now building our data warehouse. This book (described as ""the book on EDW"" by the one exec at the company who's done this before) didn't make me an expert or anything, but it provided a solid foundation of the high-level concepts and some of the major low-level issues that only come up when you're actually trying to build and maintain a data warehouse.Put another way, it didn't answer all my questions, but I was at least asking the right questions after going through it. (Ex: ""Should we handle this as an SCD-Type 1 or -Type 2 dimension?""*, rather than ""Wait, what's an SCD?"")I now spend most of my day talking and thinking about data warehouses, and I still find myself reaching for this book on a weekly basis. Take some time to read it through all the way, then keep it nearby, since it's a helpful reference guide for major concepts. (But not for any specific platform or vendor. If you want something specific to SSIS, for example, get another book. Better yet, get this one AND another book!)If you're looking for more ETL-specific information, there's another book by Ralph Kimball (and a different co-author.

The book spends a reasonable amount of time on theory, then dives into a bunch of case studies showing how to apply the theory to common scenarios. This is good instructional technique.The authors are opinionated, but in a good way. They express views on how things ought to be done, based on long experience, and this helps moves the novice along the learning curve. I've seen a few critiques in other reviews that the authors are repetitive or make a big deal out of obvious things. This actually is good instructional technique; if you want to shape the behavior of a student, you need to repeat things over and over, because no one gets it the first time. As for what is obvious or not, that varies among students. Even when a practice is obvious to a particular student, it doesn't mean that he will actually conform to that practice in real life. People are often lazy and undisciplined, and don't do the things they were taught in kindergarten.

"I am so happy I decided to buy this book. From the first page it is clear the author writes in excellent, approachable style -- there is no single place where I could find the author shows off his knowledge, nope, Graham Williams really teaches so the reader could understand. He allows to make friends with data mining in painless way; I appreciate the fact the first approach to each technique is done via GUI frontend (Rattle), but then the internals of R are explained -- the name of the package is given, how Rattle calls this or that function behind the scene, and also how to interpret the outcome, so in the end it is not only about the clicking with mouse.I find this book very valuable for two reasons -- the comfort it provides (scientific book, and you want to read more and more), and it helps you focus on modeling the data, tweaking, etc (big plus for emphasis on training, validation and testing the models). However it is introductory book (I just can wish every introductory book was so informative and friendly). It is not related to the topic of data mining, but I noticed with pleasure the clear voice for open implementations of algorithms -- I can only concur that public reviews and collaboration allow to move things forward in faster pace.If you would like to learn by example what the data mining is, how to apply, compare various algorithms this is the book for you. If you already know that and you would like to translate your knowledge to R, to some degree I would also recommend this book. This is not a book for learning R per se, so if you don't know the R it won't teach you that (rather make you a bit familiar), but don't worry, you can stick with GUI.The book is not perfect though. From time to time I missed explanation of the outcomes presented in the book -- the author does not have to spell out for me that I am looking at number ""0.74"", but the tip what does it mean is valuable (i.e. there are such explanations, but not in every desired place, at least by me). Second -- I would love to see more discussion about tough cases and how to handle them. Even such extremes, that surprised the author himself. Mistakes he did, the graphs that led him in the wrong direction, and so on. Such issues here are just lightly touched, not enough for my taste.The biggest complain is not about the content itself, but the way Springer published this book. OK, it is in color, I love it, and I am grateful. But thanks to shiny paper and weird binding, not only I couldn't put this book flat but with every page turn I had to maneuver to kill the glare. In this regard, I can say it was unpleasant experience, because of arm fatigue (book is heavy!) and all the trouble.Don't let those problems detract your from paying attention to this book -- if you are curious about data mining, or interested in it, and you are not an expert already -- solid buy!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mining with Rattle and R: The Art of Excavating Data for Knowledge Discovery (Use R!)
"R is becoming one of the leading tools of choice for serious data mining and quantitative analysis and is probably the most commonly used tool at the graduate school level today (it helps that it is open source and free!).  But as a programming language, it has a steep learning curve, at least steeper than many of the more traditional GUI-based tools for quantitative and statistical analysis like SPSS or even SAS.  This book provides a great introduction to both the topic of data mining and using the Rattle interface, which is a GUI built around typical data mining functions for the R language.  If you work through this book in detail, you will learn a fair bit the basics of the R language as well as how to complete some basic data mining tasks inside the Rattle interface.

"I am seasoned Java developer, though without any machine learning experience. A month ago I joined very promising project which core will be ML written in Python. Rest in Java. I won't implement ML part but I was looking for a book which will help me to understand ML basics. I knew Grokking Algorithms from Manning, cool book but a bit shallow. So I decided to give a try to another book from Grokking series.  And this is it. Book is written in very clear and understandable way. Author teaches from scratch, from comparison of different sorts of ML and differences between them then he starts to explain how it works. I enjoy how Luis G. Serrano introduces a concept starting from linear regression. The book contains some basic math which is again explained in very nice way then he is introducing the subject. Code in examples is written in Python but again in very simple and not idiomatic way. Which makes this code as readable as pseudo code. Then he explains how to assess model accuracy and so on.All in all it makes a very good reading for a person like me, who wants to get decent introduction to the subject. :) highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Machine Learning
"In this book, the author explains the ML algorithms in a fun way with useful examples and great code. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to enter the field of machine learning!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Machine Learning
"Serrano provides excellent material on his channel on ML topics.  His wizardry in book form has to be compelling surely? Indeed, the author explains things clearly but...there is a but...the book has a number of distracting errors.  Typos like 'Over!itting' are trivial, but variable subscripts are all over the place sometimes. The regularization chapter has a few oddities in that area (e.g. '2**2 = 2').I'm about half way through but finding some of the inconsistencies a bit tiresome.Nothing but compliments to Serrano's authoring skills and ability to communicate.  I do wonder if there were problems in production as the proof reading leaves something to be desired.The book is pitched at the reasonably serious money end of the spectrum.  It's worth if you want a clear explanation of ML concepts.  The lack of diligence on the final quality of the book is a bit of a disappointment.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Machine Learning

"I lead a biomedical research group and we are now handling a decent number of datasets.  I wanted to learn the basics of programming to achieve the complex visualisations I like and I see in scientific publications and conferences. We currently rely on free access or paid software but I’ve taken it as a personal challenge to learn how to do this myself. Most books tutorials I checked before require a basic understanding and very often their lingo is hard to follow. I’ve just started the book but so far the simple terminology and the step by step approach appeals to the absolute beginner is making this much easier and fun than I thought. The real life examples that are shown are very useful. Will wait till I get till the end and then update my review but so far so good! Also, don’t be mislead by the “for immunologists” part of the title since I think this appeals to a much broader audience.

"Great book for Immunologists with limited experience in coding statistics and graphs using R and Python. As an R user I found the choice very inclusive and helpful given my limited coding experience only in R. Unlike other books I have read, they jump right in to the statistics and graphing large data sets and clearly describe how to code commonly used graphs in publications. One of the highlights of the book is the free data set that is publicly available to test one's coding skills after reading sections of the book. That said, the description of statistical tests and the underlying mathematics is limited. This is not unexpected as it mainly focuses on teaching non-expert immunologists to code simple tests and generate publication quality graphs. Overall great and will definitely recommend the book to a fellow immunologist interested in dabbling in statistics and graphing large data sets.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science for Immunologists

"This book overall is excellent if you have a background in statistics. I can't imagine the introductory chapter on univariate statistics is sufficient for understanding the complexity of regression models covered later in the book, for instance survival analysis. I would not recommend this book for someone without a background in regression models.A small criticism is that though the author does discuss the assumption of regression models, he does not go into great detail on the diagnostic methods. For someone trying these models for the first time, this could lead to error if you do not look elsewhere for more info.Application of analytic models is the theme of this book, and in that regard it excels. My doctorate included several biostatistics and epidemiology courses, and this book was excellent in providing new extensions of those methods to marketing and showing me how to think like a marketer. I also learned plenty of new things, like latent class analysis for segmentation, and simultaneous equations, which were fun chapters.The book is well written for a fast read. The author intentionally does not go into detail on equations, which is nice for application, less so for thorough understanding. Plenty of resources are recommended in-text though to find greater detail.If you want a book that will introduce you to the application of several analytic marketing methods, many of which are drawn from biostatistics and econometrics, this book is great read.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Marketing Analytics: A Practical Guide to Improving Consumer Insights Using Data Techniques
"A bit of a strange book, confused as to its audience. Maybe.It's a bit like that college professor that covers the basic material just cause the department makes it so, then proceeds to hammer you with terse explanations and somewhat unhelpful generalizations.Listen to this, the author spends ten pages covering all of statistics from the basic definition of means all the way to probability. Yeah, and that's fine but why waste that space when you then spend 6 pages explaining what panel regression is and how to use it? And by the way, half of those pages are just tables of statistical output...And so on for most of the chapters.You do get the sense that the author is overly concerned with breadth rather than depth, and it shows in how shallow some of his chapter read. It's basically a survey of methods rather than a textbook approach to marketing analytics.The last chapter where he recounts personal experiences in his career all the way from shoe salesman to Ph.D. in tensor analysis is pretty darn good and great practical advice.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Marketing Analytics: A Practical Guide to Improving Consumer Insights Using Data Techniques

"Frankly, this book is trash. I bought it to teach myself some extra SQL and data analytics with it but what I received was an introductory SQL text with very little data analytics.There are errors located everywhere in the book to the point where I'm sure you can find at least one every couple of pages. They range from simple typos, to typos in code you're supposed to copy, and to things that are just plain wrong.Along with the errors the figures in the book are a joke. There are multiple figures that take up almost an entire page when they have no right to. An example is in the first chapter they show a scatter plot with an upward trend to cover what correlating data looks like and it took up almost the entire page. It's a scatter plot with data that doesn't matter, you don't need an entire page just enough room for the reader to clearly see what's going on. It's something a student would do to pad their page count. Other reviews said their figures were blurry but thankfully the pictures in my copy are fine... just really big.The book was written by three different authors, and it really shows. You can definitely see a style change around halfway through the book. The first part of the book also focuses on using pgAdmin and the second half focuses purely on using a command prompt. Both are fine don't get me wrong, but the shift was sudden and seems like there wasn't much collaboration between the authors. The formatting of the queries you write is also all over the place and in my opinion teaches bad habits. The first author refuses to indent anything, the second writes queries in a better manner and the third writes entire queries on one line in the command prompt throwing legibility out the window.There's a section that introduces how to use SQL with python which was nice and I was looking forward to but the chapter is short and moves back to using the command prompt the next chapter. They also cover how to use JOINs twice for whatever reason. once towards the start and once towards the end.Maybe I'm misunderstand what data analytics is/contains but there isn't much besides basic concepts in this book. If you just want to count things, find the average, organize data then okay you will get that. Anything more advanced though is out of scope for the book and you are recommended to pick up another statistics book.I did learn some new things from this book, but they don’t spend to much time on some of the more advances subjects. I wouldn’t recommend this book to anyone, it seems like it was lazily put together by the authors and I’m sure you’d be better off with some other book.",1.0 out of 5 stars,SQL for Data Analytics: Perform fast and efficient data analysis with the power of SQL

"The book itself if very helpful BUT I strongly encourage the authors to take time to revise the Index when it is printed again.  The Index is near to useless.  We get reference books like this to learn the details of code and to look up questions as we are working with the code.  This involves referring to the Index.  It seems that creating the Index was rushed - perhaps the authors created it themselves instead of having someone who knew what they were doing create it?  In any case, you find something like the word ""Select"" and then 42 (!) pages or page combinations where this word appears.  Did that help?  Not at all, unless you want to look through 42 different page references.  As a matter of fact, the entire Index is only 4 pages total which should say something in itself.  Other than this, I think the book will be helpful BUT I need a decent Index to get the most use out of it.

"Although there are quite a few positive reviews for this series of three texts by Silverston, there are also a nontrivial number of dissenters as well, who cite use of Barker's notation rather than Crow's Foot notation (i.e. Information Engineering notation) as well as unexpected contents within the accompanying CD. When first introduced to Richard Barker's ""Entity Relationship Modeling"" text during graduate school, this reviewer does admit that becoming familiar with his notation did take some time to become familiar with it, but all told it does not deviate significantly from Crow's Foot, and after a short amount of time the reader will actually notice some advantages in using it, one of which is the reduced space that substantive models need to consume. Sure, additional information not available with the CD can be purchased on Silverston's companion web site at Wiley, but it really is not necessary. Not only are these downloads not necessary, these may detract from the process of understanding the material that Silverston is attempting to present. And Silverston presents very well.As Silverston explains in Volume 1, clients have inquired on numerous occasions where they can find texts showing standard ways to model data constructs, and ""based on numerous experiences of using template or 'universal data models' and customizing them for various enterprises, we have concluded that usually more than 50 percent of the data model (corporate or logical) consists of common constructs that are applicable to most organizations, another 25 percent of the model is industry specific, and on average about 25 percent of the enterprise's data model is specific to that organization. Of course, as John Zachman indicates in this text, ""Let's get pragmatic. Starting with a universal data model does not absolve anyone of the responsibility of knowing his or her own enterprise intimately, at even an excruciating level of detail! Nor does it absolve anyone from the responsibility of learning how to build data models! What you have to do is start with the universal model, and then understanding data modeling and understanding your own enterprise, make the necessary modifications to make the universal model your own.""After presenting Barker's notation and basic modeling, the author presents models for the following industry areas in separate chapters: manufacturing, telecommunications, health care, insurance, financial services, professional services, travel, and e-commerce (the name of this last area is obviously a bit dated, since this book was published in 2001, but it does not detract in any meaningful way from the message). For each industry area, the author discusses issues of concern. For example, Silverston poses the following questions for the insurance industry: ""How can we support the insurance coverage needs of our customers?"", ""How can we best sell products and services to meet those needs while maintaining proper risk levels?"", ""How can we improve customer service and maintain our customer relationships?"", ""How can we maximize revenues, minimize costs, and still maintain excellent service levels?"", and ""How can we ensure that our systems are flexible enough to allow us to change our business models quickly and easily?"". And after explaining that information needs to be tracked in order to answer these types of questions, the author literally walks the reader through people and organizations in insurance, insurance products, insurance product coverage, insurance policies, premium schedules, and policy claims.Well recommended text, even if the reader is already familiar with the industry areas in which they are interested, because it can never hurt to get additional insight from other industry practitioners, and compared to other available resources the cost of this text is trivial.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Model Resource Book Vol. 2: A Library of Data Models for Specific Industries
"This is the second of, evidently, three books in the series of books represented as the Data Model Resource Book.  Those reading this review will likely have already purchased the first and be considering the second.  Having been in the same position not so very long ago myself, I can heartily recommend such a purchase.The book here reviewed presents standard data models tailored to specific industries.  My primary interest just now is insurance, as I work in the Insurance industry.  At my company, we use the IBM Insurance Application Architecture Data Model.  So naturally, I evaluate the author's representation of his insurance model against that very elaborate and even elegant model.  And I must that I am very favorably impressed with the description of the model contained in this book.  In fact, the description referenced above is much superior to that provided by IBM with their very elegant package.  Of course, the IBM package is more comprehensive. However, a certain aspect of this excellent book appears also to be a subtle marketing campaign for the author's more complete industry models.  Be that as it may, the book is excellent as is.  We strongly recommend its purchase and serious consideration.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Model Resource Book Vol. 2: A Library of Data Models for Specific Industries
"I purchased this book along with Volumes 1 and 3 and they've been great.  Volume 2 I purchased for the Kindle and Volumes 1 and 3 in printed form.  The Kindle version (as of 9/2010) was a mistake for the following reasons:(Running Kindle for PC on Windows 2010)1) Table of Contents:  The links don't work correctly.  So effectively, you are buying a book with no table of contents.  Worse, since they take you to the wrong place, but the Kindle does't display where you are at by chapter or heading, its very confusing.  Click on the TOC link for ""Orders"" for the professional services chapter, and you will end up in the manufacturing chapter, but you don't know it.2) Appendix Tables: These are rotated in the book, but there is no way to rotate the Kindle for PC, so they are difficult to read.3) Bookmarks: The ones I've created are hard to read (can't assign names) and jump to the previous page.So the Kindle version as a Reference Book is a pain.But do buy the printed version, and when they fix the kindle version, it should be fine too.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Model Resource Book Vol. 2: A Library of Data Models for Specific Industries
"As others have stated, the CD included with the book is (effectively) only an advertisement for the models for sale on the web site.  Frankly, I find this offensive, since books that have CDs are generally much more expensive because (normally) the CD has additional useful content, CDs cost money to make, etc.  I doubt that I would buy another of Mr. Silverston's books after having this disappointing experience.  The models themselves seem well thought-out and useful, but if you're looking for something that will save you time and money, you'd be better off purchasing a model from one of the many industry-specific standards organizations (e.g. ACORD).  Those models will be much more detailed and recognizable between multiple organizations.",2.0 out of 5 stars,The Data Model Resource Book Vol. 2: A Library of Data Models for Specific Industries

"I was hesitant to buy this book based on some reviews that I read, but I decided to give it a shot nonetheless.For context, I’m currently a Software Engineer looking to make a transition over to Data Engineering in the future. I had little knowledge of the field, so I was looking for a book to give me a bit of a foundation on it.For me, the first and second sections of the book were really good for a conceptual understanding of the techniques and jargon within DE. Especially the first section!What threw me a little off was the constant reference to NiFi. Don’t get me wrong though, I did enjoy learning about it and also I think it was useful to understand that DE’s use a variety of different tools in their day to day (which was a plus for me).I just think the title is slightly misleading as Python is not always referenced. I think it got more exposure in the first section, but died down a bit in the latter half of the second section and then got referenced just a bit in the last one. Also, the Python implementation used in NiFi is Jython and not the default implementation that many probably use. Also, and I could be totally mistaken, but it seems that the most recent Jython version uses Python 2.7? Seemed a bit backwards to me to reference such an outdated version, but that’s in no way the author’s fault.I gave a 4 out of 5 stars just because some examples of NiFi simply didn’t work even though I followed the steps correctly. This could be because things have changed with the software since the release of the book, but I’m not totally sure….In any case, I would still recommend this book to get a decent conceptual knowledge on DE principles, but I would do what others suggested and look at the documentations of the tools referenced to get a more updated view of them and work on personal projects utilizing them to apply the knowledge that was taught in this reading.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Engineering with Python: Work with massive datasets to design data models and automate data pipelines using Python

"Data Engineering With Python provides a solid overview of pipelining and database connections for those tasked with processing both batch and stream data flows.

Also introduces Great Expectations, NiFi, Airflow, and Faker, all of which are tied together in a usable demonstration environment. Pipeline implementation’s thoroughly covered as well.Misses — the book could use a little fine-tuning as to Python 3; some of the instructions are rather downrev, and concepts like 311 / SeeClickFix are sort of dropped in without a lot of explanation.

"Whether you are a beginner or an intermediate user of Tableau, this book comes in handy in teaching mastery of business intelligence using Tableau. The authors have leveraged their vast industry experience to really teach the concepts in a simple yet detailed approach.From this book you'll get to understand how and when to blend, join or union your data, functions and table calculations, data densification, how to deal with big data in Tableau, visualization best practices among other core concepts. What I really like about the book is that you get illustrated outputs that help you while you are practising. Further, every concept builds upon each other and you kind of get the hang of those hardcore concepts pretty fast through practical use cases where you get a feel of real-world scenarios.I would highly recommend the book for anyone who would like to dive deep into mastery of their business intelligence skills. I give the book a 10/10 because it not only teaches you the fundamentals but also teaches you the integration with python and R to achieve things that are impossible with Tableau's native functionalities alone.

"I have a strong interest in information security and quantitative research, so people who know me in person could imagine how giddy I felt when I came across this book... especially since it was published by the No Starch Press! It's a great introduction and I learnt about a lot of neat statistical concepts reading this book: like Jaccard's index, n-grams, ROC curves, decision boundaries, network analysis with Python, visualisation, and a lot more.The book also came with a lot of practical exercises where the reader can analyse malware on a virtual machine. I did not do all the exercises, so this review may be a bit biased regarding some of the criticisms.I feel that the authors could have given a more rigourous treatment of machine learning constructs (the exception to this is their discussion of deep learning in chapters 10 and 11). But given that this is an introductory book for infosec analysts, they might be laying off the mathy bits as to not intimidate them, so it's understandable. Also, the reference for disassembly with Python and dynamic analysis with Cuckoo Sandbox seems light, so I feel that they could have expanded on that.Other than that, this was a great introduction to the interdisciplinary study of cybersecurity and statistical analysis.

"As a data scientist and machine learning practitioner I was disappointed in this book.  Admittedly the authors faced the very difficult task of trying to communicate the relationship of two very deep and technical subjects: malware analysis and machine learning.  The result, unfortunately, is a work that is only the barest introduction to both.The first half of the book dips a toe in the ocean of malware static analysis, dynamic analysis, and reverse engineering.  Not knowing anything about malware, this section of the book did indeed spark my curiosity and supply me with strong motivation to continue my studies in malware analysis with other, more comprehensive resources.The second half of the book is a shallow overview of basic, elementary topics in machine learning and common tools used by practitioners.  This overview is accompanied by proof-of-concept applications to malware detection.  The machine learning overview will not supply any new knowledge to anyone who has any practical experience in machine learning and for a complete beginner it is insufficient even as a first course.In summary, this is not a bad book as the authors are clearly technically proficient, good writers, and passionate about their area of expertise.  Nonetheless, be aware that if you are not already an expert in malware AND machine learning you will need to follow up this short read with much more detailed sources.

"I really enjoyed BBOD, and I am incorporating its many nuggets into my dashboards. Learning by example and counter-example is the best method (see Siegfried Engelmann fore more on that), and that's the format of this book. There are related webinars on the Tableau website that are definitely worth listening to.The thing to keep in mind about this book is that's it's not a step-by-step cookbook of how to technically achieve vizzes in Tableau. It's a book about design. It can quickly take you from making average, hum-drum (if not disorganized and confusing) dashboards to world-class material.Below are some thoughts on certain vizzes/chapters:·  CH 2 and 20 - Course Metrics and Complaints - I would encourage Tableau to research gray text readability. Perhaps I have a genetic rod deficiency, or maybe it's because of my age, but I find the gray text to be hard to read. I think the effort to reduce contrast crosses a usability threshold. I'd like to see some tests of a type ""solve a problem in this dashboard"" with different gray scales in text. I'd wager darker equals a faster solution up to a certain point after which it doesn't matter. There are a lot of factors that contribute to this: monitor size, font size, bold, brightness, contrast, so you have to experiment with what works for you and the majority or your users.·  CH 11 - Premier League Player Performance Metric. I think the applicability of this viz approach can be generalized even further to unit:subset:universe. For this football (soccer) viz, it's the most recent match, 5 next most recent, then all season. So the viz is by sets according to time. It could also be by organizational hierarchy as in employee: department: division for a fixed time period. In this same manner, Chapter 3 (speaker ratings) is conceptually equivalent, but it lacks the subset level. You could have speaker, topic area, and then all others.  CH 12 - Rugby Dashboard - This is an interesting chapter. One option for a scoring viz us using Gantt Bars. t would be nice the book's dashboard were shaded between the lines to emphasize who is leading. I know this is a long-sought (by some) Tableau function, and maybe it's not too hard to implement if it's reimagined as a ""Gantt Line"", which would be identical to a Gantt Bar use case, except that it graphs lines while coloring the intermediate space. You can kinda do that with 3 levels of unstacked area charts... but not exactly.·  CH 21 - Overall, I like the aesthetics of the Hospital Operating room dashboard, but I expected the screaming cat icon (""don't do this!"") over the top of it. The calendar of the viz resembles the periodic table of elements, and the labels seem to be at odds with the ""reduce clutter"" guideline. The numbers are just a bit too much for me, but they could be exactly what the customer wanted in this case. Hey, chemists LIKE the periodic table! And some people don't want to hover for tooltip details, or they may have other motivations. I like to try to put myself in the shoes of the consumer and ask ""Would the color itself be sufficient for me to make an actionable decision?"" To me, the numbers don't have to be on the viz, and the calendars can be shrunken to show other information, but the dashboard isn't designed for me.Overall, this book is a ""top shelf"" selection on dashboard design that you can revisit over and over for best practices.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Big Book of Dashboards: Visualizing Your Data Using Real-World Business Scenarios

"Despite the title, this book is more about visually presenting individual data sets (perhaps for presentations), rather than identifying and monitoring critical business processes via a ""dashboard"".An automobile dashboard has achieved a high state of refinement over the last century and is the iconic example of monitoring important parameters in real time.  Ideally, a dashboard should:* Monitor a few selected, important parameters (the business key performance indicators [KPI's]),* Compare these parameters to predetermined limits (like red lines or alarm points), and* Display the rate of change in time to permit correction, if necessary (how fast am I speeding up or slowing down?)all in one easily understood display.Out of all the performance data a business should have available, a select few of these should be designated as KPI's that will give a heads up to check in more depth if they depart from norms (e.g., sales calls per week, phone inquiries per day, warranty claims per month, etc.).A business dashboard should consist of those KPI's that are PREDICTIVE of future business activity or quality.  So, a business-specific dashboard should be the KPI's identified that will continually assess these few parameters, compare them to established norms, allow interpretation of the information at a glance, and allow enough lead time to intervene before there are adverse consequences.Unfortunately, the book doesn't seem to offer any advice on how to select KPI's for particular types of businesses or how to arrange and present multiple KPI's (i.e., build a car-like dashboard) in such a way as to allow a human to rapidly assess the health of a business.  Further, it doesn't even appear to suggest types of software that allow creation of the types of charts and graphs presented in their examples.The book is professionally edited and published on quality stock, but it falls short of the promise implied in the title.",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Big Book of Dashboards: Visualizing Your Data Using Real-World Business Scenarios
"I just got mine in the mail and certainly have not read it, but I've skimmed every page.From a CFO's perspective, love it!Just a couple more observations which one reviewer has already addressed:1. You don't read this book. I suppose you could. It's a reference book. I'll be hitting several of the chapters that are very pragmatic and relevant to my situation.2. If you see Andy Cotgreave's name on this book, don't worry about it. Yeah, he's a beast and over the top like his co-authors, but there is something for everyone--novices, beginners, intermediates, and pros. There is something for everyone here.3. And that leaves me to a new, slightly controversial comment. No criticism aimed at Stephen Few. I own all of his books. But The Big Book of Dashboards is practical. Interested in visualizing your NPS data? No problem. Sales dashboards? Check. I only bring this up because I almost didn't buy the book since I owned all of Few's. There is some overlap, but you will not be disappointed.I only have one gripe while still giving 5 stars. I want sample files. It appears many visuals were completed in Tableau, right? Backup files, Please. That would be great.Otherwise, this book is an easy 5 stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Big Book of Dashboards: Visualizing Your Data Using Real-World Business Scenarios
"This is a great book if you are stuck on bar charts and line charts and you know you can be doing better, but you just don't know how to do it.  I can't say that the book was revolutionary and I didn't exclaim  ""Wow!"" or ""Ah!"" at any point while reading it, but it gives some solid examples of dashboards and thoughtful insights.The book focuses on the construction and logic behind dashboarding using some standard examples (hospital activity, sales, financials), so if you are looking for the nitty gritty of how to build these visualizations you need to go back to your Tableau 101.  This is about figuring out the best way to convey lots of information without overloading the reader.  This will become a reference book in my department and I foresee pulling it out for users to give examples of dashboarding ideas.I only wish there would have been more before and after examples.  It is helpful to see what people are starting with and the thought process that created the final product.Overall, it is a helpful book that will guide data visualizers to the next level.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Big Book of Dashboards: Visualizing Your Data Using Real-World Business Scenarios
"In the companies I usually see people not knowing from where to start in building their dashboard. And telling them ""think about the story and your workflow"" is not sufficient.The book gives good starting point to such users - examples, why they work, what are other applications.If you are searching for reference/guidelines/inspiration for business dashboards it is good book. However, infographics are barely covered - missing some good examples of interactive work that is between dashboard and infographic. Technology has come far to support more than static.However if you have longer experience in the field, you will find yourself thinking that authors failed in making every chapter be excellent.Some chapters seemed well thought and detailed, while some chapters seemed as not providing enough discussion - you see that certain dashboard could had been done much better, and from there at least some other solutions could have been discussed.Having less chapters with actual examples and having more deeper content on other chapters would create a better result.I missed the wow effect, and the book didn't open completely new horizons for me.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Big Book of Dashboards: Visualizing Your Data Using Real-World Business Scenarios

"This is an outstanding book and by far the best machine learning book of the several I have read. I highly recommend.1) The author writes this in a way that you can perform machine learning tasks in R without any prior experience using R or ML. He gets you up to speed quickly on how to download R Studio and explains everything you need to know about R in order to perform the ML tasks that are described later in the book. He doesn't explain all of the things you can do in R as in many other books, because you don't necessarily need to know everything about R to perform ML tasks and this book is about ML. So this is obviously not a book that is exhaustive of everything possible in R.2) The structure of this book is outstanding and very logical. Within each of the chapters on Machine Learning models, he describes the model and how it works, includes a section covering the model's syntax in R, the strengths and weaknesses of each model, compares the model to the prior models discussed, and then uses that foundation to walk you through an example of applying each model to real data. Within the examples, he uses the 5 steps of a modeling process: 1) collecting data, 2) exploring and prepping the data, 3) training the model, 4) evaluating model performance, and 5) Improving model performance. I love this structure!3) His explanations of everything are outstanding. I've read several ML books and he by far is the best at explaining things in a way that people can clearly understand. If the model involves statistical concepts, he explains what you need to know very well.4) The book covers many ML models: K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Classification Rules, Regression, Regression Trees, Model Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Association Rules, K-Means Clustering, and Random Forests. For an advanced Data Scientist, this may not seem like an exhaustive list. However, I feel that for a beginning data scientist or someone that is just interested in getting a good overview of data modeling, I feel this is a great choice of model coverage.Bottom line- if you're at all interested in machine learning in R, this is the book to get. If you're already an advanced data scientist with years of experience, this may not be the best text for you, though.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R: Expert techniques for predictive modeling 3rd Edition
"I received the book just recently. I will update my review of the contents later. Two things I noticed right away are (a) The 'dataspelunking.com' website mentioned above (in the Amazon description) and in the book, is an empty shell; and (b)  The link in the preface pointing to a page containing a PDF of color-images of the screenshots/diagrams in the book is broken, leading to a 404 message. The kindest thing one can say about this is that the book has been rushed to publication and released before the associated resources are ready. At worst this is a misrepresentation. While those color figures are not a big loss, this carelessness does not bode well for the attention to detail with which the book was produced, especially since it is in its 3rd edition.Edited: Packt repaired the broken link and contacted me here to point that out.

"So my issue with this book isn't that it's introductory. I think that fact is quite obvious, actually. My main issues are as follows:First of all, some of the code is just...odd. The author writes bizarre code that is oddly inefficient and imparts the use of inefficient code on beginners. For example, if he shows us how to extract labels for rows x to y and the labes are in a column in a dataframe, he shows us how extracts all the columns for rows x to y and then subsets out the column of interest...why???And second, i wish there was a little more thought into how the book was organized. Not in the order of chapters, but in how the chapters and example problems are appraoched. For example, the author cites packages and tells the reader to install them as they are used in a problem, instead of at the beginning. It would have been very helpful, for example, if at the beginning of each chapter, the packages and datasets used were listed, with links if applicable. Having to stop following the example problems just to install and load a package is quite annoying.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with R: Expert techniques for predictive modeling 3rd Edition

Next, the book goes into the ML with good illustrations using physical representations for easier understanding. It goes on to some vector/component concepts in SVM (obviously) but still retains the intuitive properties of the book.  The book chapters, generally, are independent and can be read as stand alone without much loss in understanding.

"I was recently asked to review the book Machine Learning in Biotechnology and Life Sciences authored by Saleh Alkhalifa and wanted to share the review with my LinkedIn network.This book was written for audiences ranging from data scientists with minimal biology/chemistry background to those with minimal coding experience with an extensive background in the sciences. Alkhalifa walks a fine line targeting this span of audiences and does a phenomenal job getting the reader up to speed starting with simple tutorials in Python and SQL, providing useful data libraries for readers to utilize while they explore AI/ML, and even providing an overarching explanation of many of the key concepts an individual looking to deploy ML models would need to understand. The book is structured by providing a rapid overview of each preliminary concept before diving into a step-by-step tutorial on how to utilize or integrate the concept that was just discussed. Topics range from Python, SQL, basics of ML (supervised and unsupervised), Natural Language Processing, and deploying models.While the book provides excellent breadth on the topics required to understand ML, the depth in many instances in lacking simply due to the complexity of topics – fitting a rapid review + tutorials of each topic into <400 pages I imagine is challenging enough.I would recommend this text to those looking to take the leap between learning about AI/ML and applying that knowledge by developing models. The material is not in-depth enough for early beginners to grasp many of the underlying concepts well enough for this text to be a first interaction with AI/ML, but the tutorials and walkthroughs provide those with preliminary understanding a great jumping off point to begin developing their own models.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Biotechnology and Life Sciences: Build machine learning models using Python and deploy them on the cloud

Additionally, the book covers how to apply that to the Biotech industry and gives you some basic steps on how to deploy a model in the cloud.What I liked was that the author gives a quick theory followed by practical examples in each chapter.Given that it brings a lot of different concepts, the theory is not super deep, but enough for you to understand what's the subject and what to do with that.I wouldn’t say it is a book for beginners, but definitely a good addition to any Data Scientist’s library.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Biotechnology and Life Sciences: Build machine learning models using Python and deploy them on the cloud
"This is a good book for beginners who would like to get started with machine learning. Despite its title, the book contains useful information for anyone (not just Biotechnologists) interested in getting started with machine learning. The first chapter covers the basics of python but it helps if the reader comes with some python coding knowledge. Also, the book covers the basics of handling databases as it is common to work with them in Biotechnology.Section two of the book focuses on machine learning and deep learning where the authors introduce the concepts of supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The basics of deep learning are also covered including the explanation of artificial neurons, activation functions, and loss functions. The last section is devoted to deploying models so others can use your trained models.Please note that this book does not cover any aspects of image processing or analysis.

"This book offers a clearly written introduction to Machine Learning applications in Life Sciences.  The scope of the book is well suited to readers entering or looking to enter this field professionally.  Its coverage of Machine Learning fundamentals and related topics is more practical than theoretical, and generally more broad than deep.  It does not survey up-to-date research, and recent advances in areas like protein folding prediction are not covered.The book often follows a pattern in which a new concept is introduced along side a new tool.  The author uses this style very effectively to convey a wide range of practical knowledge in relatively few pages.  Plentiful examples allow the reader to follow along with the Python code in the book and the accompanying GitHub repository.  The reader will be exposed to a wide range of tools and ideas, and given a functional understanding of these topics sufficient to continue their own exploration.Matthew Woods, PhD",4.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Biotechnology and Life Sciences: Build machine learning models using Python and deploy them on the cloud
"The author, Saleh Alkhalifa has done an extraordinary job in putting together a masterpiece that encompasses all aspects of Machine Learning in Biotechnology and Life Sciences. It's very hard to find a book that covers this particular topic and such a broad range of topics in the market. I liked the organization of sections and chapters in the book which is a logical progression of learning for an ML researcher and shows the author's expertise and understanding of this area in greater depth. The beauty of this book is that it caters to the needs of all levels whether you are a biology researcher or biotechnologist trying to embark on the journey of Machine Learning or you are a junior Data Scientist attempting to improve your understanding of ML or an established Data Scientist who would need a quick rerun of concepts. I find this book to be extremely useful in my current role as a Data Science lead to revise the concepts and update my Machine Learning skills as it pertains to Biotechnology and Life Sciences. The book has tons of real-world examples, use cases, and problems, unlike any other book which only shows that the author has spent a considerable amount of time researching what's out there and including only relevant topics in this book.The book sets the context perfectly by introducing the concepts of ML to Life Sciences and Biotechnology. The rest of the chapters include an introduction to the basics of programming languages such as Python and SQL, basics and advanced topics in ML, DL, NLP, Time Series Data analysis, etc., The book ultimately ends with deploying the built models on the cloud. All along with the book, Saleh Alkhalifa has explained the concepts very well in the context of the algorithms and use cases along with the hands-on instructions for the same. Overall, the author has done an extraordinary job in identifying and including only the most popular tools, technologies, algorithms, frameworks, and infrastructure.The book is however missing some key concepts such as Cross-validation, Sampling, Regularization, Hyperparameter tuning, Feature engineering, and Model interpretability and I wish the author should have included these in the use case examples which would have elevated the book to another level.That said, if there is one book that I want to highly recommend if you are a life science researcher trying to get into ML in Biotechnology and Life Sciences then this is it.

It covers introductory topics like what is a vector, list, etc but it also gives a good first presentation on topics that are left out of introductory books.  You will pick up the vocabulary you need to read advanced books.  Easy to understand topics, like what are formal arguments, free variables, lazy evaluation etc. are presented without distractions.  The coverage on confusing topics like single and double square-bracket notation is some of the best out there. Advanced topics like scoping rules and functions that return functions are also well covered.This book is also a nice bridge between old school R programming styles and the modern Tidyverse mindset.  You will get an excellent first look at many of the libraries that are in the Tidyverse.The book does contain links to videos covering the same material.

"The original title: Surprise! Abductive Analysis in Action, conveys the message of this valuable book much better than the rather meaningless title it was eventually given for marketing reasons. After reading their previous book, Abductive analysis, and the announcement of this sequel, I was eagerly awaiting this book, after reading it I can say it was worth waiting for. In their new book, Timmermans and Tavory provide qualitative researchers with guidelines on how to set up and carry out their research in such a way that it also contributes to the development of theories. Their thesis is that an abductive analysis means that you conduct qualitative research in a different way from the very first moment.(p. 4) “The actual work of qualitative research – both finding surprises and making sense of them – is the work of coding, teasing out variation, and constructing theoretical narratives for data excerpts.”(p. 38).The focus of this book is on analyzing the research data in an abductive way. Data Analysis in Qualitative Research provides advice on core practices across the whole qualitative research arc. It is therefore not a recipe book, but rather a book that provides insight into what abductive analysis means in the different phases of qualitative research. Timmermans and Tavory make their proposed working method tangible because their text is interspersed with small and large examples. A summary does not do justice to this rich book. Below I will give an impression of the main argument of this book, based on quotations from key passages.After a short recap of abductive analysis, the different ways in which you can use theory in this analysis are discussed. Theory as map and theory as compass. You need maps to orient yourself on the content of the area you are researching. You need a compass to move around in that area. Timmermans and Tavory argue in favor of delving into the map theory of your research. They are especially annoyed by researchers who do not delve into the available map theory or only a very limited part of it. Unlike grounded theory, they consider it the responsibility of the researcher to thoroughly immerse himself in the available substantive theory. This enables you to track down the surprises - the discrepancies between observations and the prevailing views in the literature. Everything is surprising without delving into the substantive literature. Compass theory can also fail to explain findings from fieldwork. Then another compass is required.“Surprises assume that something in the data doesn’t behave as it should based on what prevailing map of compass theories predict.”(p. 67) “Even before you code your data, you need to ensure that the data you have will provide you not only with possibilities of surprise but with strong evidentiary grounds to develop promising findings.”(p. 68) Timmermans and Tavory distinguish between two types of coding: open coding and focused coding, to which they each devote a whole chapter. Unlike open coding in grounded theory, open coding in abductive analysis gives “initial sense of the theoretical potential of your observations.”(p. 72) Interrogate your data asking who did what, when, where, how and with what consequences.(p. 73) “Surprises need to be teased out of the observations you have now. (..) The trick of open coding is to allow yourself to open your observations in different directions, but to do so with some idea where you are opening a door to.” (p.88-89)“Focused coding means that you settle upon a promising theme and then code within it. (..) Focused coding starts with what you think the case is most likely about, and ends with a close examination of what you actually have.”(p. 92) You construct a “proto-set” an initial set of observations that you will later winnow down. You search for an index case that anchors the analysis you are embarking on.(p. 93). Two very detailed examples show what focused coding looks like in practice. This enables researchers to make the translation to their own qualitative research. Incidentally, it is surprising that in both examples the original research question could so easily be jettisoned. In both cases, the research data seem to determine the research question. This is a strange turn of events, even for a qualitative researcher.Even after open en focused coding you need to hunt for clues of possible surprises.(p. 115) Surprises emerge against a background of theoretical expectations, different hunts, habitats, clues are possible. How can you interrogate your data in a theoretically generative way. Timmermans and Tavory make a plea to use the different kinds of tensions and incongruities in the data as points of reference. As a qualitative researcher you go against the official narrative, you have to be intellectually subversive. Going against the grain produces valuable clues about interesting things just below the surface.(p. 128) Tensions and surprises cannot exist without each other. Tensions force us to stand still in our tracks. A surprise is a narrative turning point. A turning point depends on the ability to stand still for a while. We need the ability to stand still to take a different path. By intersperse their text with small and large examples, Timmermans and Tavory make their proposed working method tangible.In Chapter 8 Writing it down, writing it up, Timmermans and Tavory advocate rhetorical abduction, a detective narrative in which you don't give away the denouement in the introduction, but only at the end. A good place to start for write-up is the index case. The remainder of this chapter provides insight into how the peer review process of a journal article resulted in an additional abductive loop.All in all, this is a very valuable book that equips qualitative researchers to detect surprises in their research and thus contribute to theorizing. It is a book that deserves to be read several times making the intended abductive analysis more and more tangible with each reading.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis in Qualitative Research: Theorizing with Abductive Analysis

"In a small number of pages, the book covers many topics, and it is a good introduction for beginners or people managing a team of data scientists. On the flip side, it lacks depth, being more like a general summary on the topic. The value is that it explains a lot of methods and good practices, so many that even the expert is bound to learn something new, about some popular topic he heard about but only has a vague idea of what it means. This book will fill this gap.For in-depth coverage of selected modern machine learning topics with new research results focused on applications and a unified approach, with plenty of Python code yet 150 pages total, I suggest checking out my book ""Intuitive Machine Learning and Explainable AI"", also self-published.Such books are very well rendered in the PDF version, however the print version does not give them justice. Mine will never be printed, and if by chance it ever does, it will be on high quality paper and in color. Even then, a print version will always lack the HTML-like navigation features available in online versions.Compared to other similar books, at least Andriy's book has high-quality figures printer in color, and well rendered on paper.

"Disclaimer: The author asked me to review this book, though I had already purchased my own copy.  I promise to be 100% honest in how I feel about this book, both the good and the less so.Overview:This book does exactly what it states.  It's a 100+ page book that gives you an overview of machine learning, the math behind most of the reviewed techniques so you can follow along with current research to an extent), and QR code links to further reading.  The author also follows a 'read first, buy later' policy, which I respect.The book is very well organized, giving the reader an introduction and discussion on the mathematical notation used, a well written chapter that discusses several very common algorithms, talks about best practices (like feature engineering, breaking up the data into multiple sets, and tuning the model's hyperparameters), digs deeper into supervised learning, discusses unsupervised learning, and gives you a taste of a variety of other related topics.What I Like:This is a well rounded book, far more so than most books I've read on machine learning or artificial intelligence.  After reading through this, I feel like I can competently discuss the subject, read one of the simpler machine learning research papers, and not be totally lost on the mathematics involved.  The language used is concise and reads very well, showing very tight editing.What I Didn't Care For:I know that this is a general introduction and meant to be kept short.  Like many other reviewers, however, I would have enjoyed a deeper look into everything that was in this book.What I Would Like To See:I know that the author is currently writing a data engineering book without the 100 page limitation.  Personally, I would like to see him write a ML Math book (I'm weird like that) as well as an MLOps book.  I expect the later to be what he writes next, if he chooses to continue writing.Overall, I got a LOT out of this book and look forward to more.  I am giving a rating of 4.8 out of 5.

I can confidently say, just a few chapters into this book, that this is the book I was missing!I have followed Andriy on LinkedIn for a long time now, and always appreciated his posts. When I saw he was publishing a book, I didn't think twice and ordered it. As expected, the book is clear, concise and does a thorough job explaining basic mathematical concepts, machine learning principles, and the most important fundamentals to understand the field.One note: I can tell this book will be useful for a long time. I have many tech related books that become obsolete a few years or even months after they are published. Andriy's approach delves into the core principles, while explaining how to understand further developments into the field. This is something I was missing and truly appreciate.I have a quirk of reading physical books alongside a text-to-speech interface on a digital device. Especially with text books, this is helpful, but not all textbooks are capable of being processed this way. Fortunately, when you purchase the physical book, Andriy sends you the digital edition as well. As a result, I have been able to breeze through the text in my ideal learning state.For those who have been working around the academic machine learning world, but are influenced by it - buy this book!

"In 2018 I was nominated for Data Scientist of the Year for Nashville, and became a finalist. Machine learning has been a big part of my career since 2005. I would like to say I don’t need a book like THPMLB, however, it is a fantastic resource. There is math in this book, and the reader will want to find a resource to become familiar with the notation, if they don’t already know it. I’ve always found the notation is the first filter for people getting into science of any type. However, the notation is more complex looking than it is once you know what the symbols mean. In the end, all math devolves down to a few basic operations and notation simply implies several assumptions about how to apply them.What makes the book excellent is the very plain-speaking method in which the lessons are taught. This isn’t someone trying to impress PhD’s in their field. This is someone looking to talk to you about machine learning. This straightforward approach will help you learn machine learning techniques.For someone like me, it offers a handy reference to techniques I’ve used but forgot the details to, or techniques I’ve wanted to explore. Its small size makes it easy to find what you are looking for, get a basic understanding, and launch you into further learning.Finally, this is a living product and there is a constantly updated wiki for this book. That alone is worth the small price you’d pay for this book. This book gets my highest recommendation.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book
"This was a very unique book.  I enjoyed being able to get such a quick introduction (read the book in one week, about 1hr/night) to such a vast array of ML topics.  But, at the same time, reading it so quickly, I probably didn’t retain much. I suspect I’ll reread this book several times, with months in between, and have a new appreciation, and increased retention, each time.My review comes from the perspective of someone who has a master’s in math, but is just starting to learn about machine learning (beyond simple regression).I appreciated that the book got right to the point on each topic, allowing me to get through so many topics so quickly. It was NOT a superficial treatment either (as far as I know, being new to the subject). He mentions several techniques/tips, and includes many equations, but just doesn’t dwell on any topic for more than a few sentences.I wouldn’t say this is a good book for a course, which should include more on the topics it covers. There’s also no questions/problems to test understanding.But then again, the book includes many QR codes to additional material, that I haven’t tried yet, so maybe that has practice questions.All in all, I think that if you’re new to ML, and want a quick introduction, this is worth th $40.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book

This book provides the material in an accessible, easy to read manner without going to much in formal mathematics except what is needed. From my own experience, I can tell that often times, capturing the gist of the algorithm, equations or methods is more important than formally work them out. Once we get the central idea, the so-called the spinal cord, it is often times easy to dive deeper and be more formal.

Just looking at the table of contents, the book starts off with the basics of Machine Learning and covering your basic algorithms such as Linear Regression or Logistic Regression. The book proceeds to follow a natural progression of getting into more advanced models like Support Vector Machine, before really diving into advanced topics such as Deep Learning. One final positive aspect of the book is the balance in explaining the mathematics of Machine Learning.

"Overall this is an excellent book.  The best part is there are many specific suggestions which introduce methods with which the reader may not be familiar.  Examples include using Counter() to inspect dictionaries for unexpected number of keys, some useful json methods, select_dtypes() to include or exclude columns, and many more. I appreciated introducing filter() with regular expressions or like, something every data scientist should know. The author makes good use of lambda functions to streamline cleaning steps. He introduces some concepts around finding outliers or unusual values, using statsmodels which is very nice, as well as quantile methods. Sub-setting using np.where(), a method I use often, is applied frequently. Some less known tidbits are using itertuples.  The book wraps up introducing SQL-like methods (merge etc.) and how to handle issues when combining data.My only wishes to improve the book are two-fold. First, there is minimal use of graphics (charts, etc.) which runs a bit counter to most EDA approaches. Second, the formatting of the code and output is such that most of the lines are wrapped, making the examples harder to read.I recommend this book to data scientists at any level.

It’s not just a cookbook, it also explains how to think and go about cleaning data, tells you what types of ‘dirtiness’ to look for and expect, and gives context and reasoning behind the techniques it discusses. It covers basic to advanced data cleaning and manipulation, including tips to develop routines and automation. I find this book a very helpful timesaver and it has quickly surpassed google and library docs as my go-to reference guide for data preparation tasks.As for the explanations, they are clear, structured, and comprehensive, and contain important pointers about potential problems and how to set up the workflow to avoid them. I recommend reading them through before using the code and highlighting the parts you will likely need to reference again. When there are multiple ways of doing the same thing it goes through a bunch of them and discusses when to use which. For example it will give tips on which options to use for speed or for production code. It also covers important but generally unsung topics like identifying logical inconsistencies and dealing with oddly structured data.I wish I would have had this book a long time ago, it would have saved me a lot of frustration and time. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Data Cleaning Cookbook: Modern techniques and Python tools to detect and remove dirty data and extract key insights

"Python Data Cleaning Cookbook is a goldmine. I recently completed a master’s of data science and lament that I didn’t have this book during that time.

There’s a lot more than data cleaning going on.I especially appreciate the key insights that readers get from the author, who is a seasoned data practitioner. I love that he points out the red flags and best practices that apply to the respective situations.

"The book provides a good introduction to the concepts. The problem, however, is that the book is woefully lacking in its presentation of implementing the concepts in Python. Compounding the issue is that the code shown in the book does not always produce the results shown. For example, when trying to follow along with the logistic regression example in Chp. 10, the book shows a nice table with all the model coefficients labeled. The code provided, however, results in a table that contains only about two-thirds of the coefficients.  If you are already an expert in Python, you would probably find another way to show the coefficients such that they are nicely labeled. But if you are not an expert in Python, this book will undoubtedly cause tremendous frustration.  Adding to the difficulty is that there is no way to access the code provided in the book online.  You need to re-type everything in addition to looking up details on implementation that are not provided in the text. Another frustration is that there appear to be several inconsistencies in the text. For example, the reference variables defined in the data pre-processing discussion of an example are different than the reference variables in the Python code and different than the reference variables used in the model interpretation discussion of the same example.  It makes for many headaches if you want to actually follow along and learn.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mining for Business Analytics: Concepts Techniques and Applications in Python
"My journey reading and solving virtually all the problems in all the chapters of this book was a bittersweet one. Truth be told, there are codes and logic that you will need to solve some problems and you have to do your own research to figure them out and it can be quite discouraging if you don't have a good background in python. The book doesn't teach you everything you need to know before solving some problems and use cases. Also note that some packages like ""surprise"" used in Chap 14 won't work on Jupyter notebook. I had to run some packages on kaggle before they could work. There were days I spent countless hours understanding and implementing some of the concepts taught but it was always worth it. It would have been nice if the authors gave useful tips for some difficult problems and also made provision for checking the accuracy of our solutions. I particularly enjoyed the time series problems and i hope the authors will improve on this book in subsequent editions.

"I had been looking for a book to bridge the gap between implementing machine learning code on the granular level and understanding it from a theoretical perspective and the search wasn't going well. Lots of other books that I tried before finding this one promised to help programmers become better mathematicians (or at least show them the math they need to learn in order to achieve that goal) but would almost always just provide code without context, or run through some incredibly basic, introductory level math without explaining at all how it connects to the various machine learning algorithms you'll be implementing as a programmer.This book, however, takes the math seriously, and is incredibly direct and efficient in the introduction of new, relevant topics in calculus, linear algebra, and probability and statistics that you'll need to know if you want to truly understand the libraries you're using. I find myself reading a section in the book, going back to a ""dedicated"" textbook on the subject at hand - linear algebra or calculus or probability and statistics - and further studying the material, and then going back to Mathematics for Machine Learning to make sure I understand the topic better.

"“Statistics for Health Data Science - An organic approach"" does an amazing job delivering a number of key and applied statistical concepts in a very clear and truly organic way. The book starts every chapter laying out basic foundations with motivating questions and examples before diving into more advanced details. The demonstrated examples are very thoughtful, comprehensive and help deliver the concepts fluidly. Each chapter also ends with a section that provides links to the R code to download data as well as examples from the book that can be carried out in GitHub. The book has dedicated chapters for regression analyses with emphasis on the different outcomes types which collectively give a panorama of approaches. In addition, I particularly found the chapter on Prediction to be conceptually stimulating, yet it laid out the concept in a very digestible way. Overall, this book has an organic flow that definitely makes for a wonderful read!

"I got this book when I was transitioning to doing data science with Python and was struggling to become familiar with standard tools. It's written by the creator of Pandas, and follows the style of the Pandas documentation: dense, telegraphic, peppered with examples.It's hard work because Wes McKinney often does not articulate why you would need to do something (assuming you are already knowledgeable on the underlying process), and writes like an impatient person who would rather be doing something else. Additionally examples often suffer from being both too long and too short - too long in that almost every example is on a toy dataset created from scratch, too short in that most of those datasets have only 5 or 10 elements and do not always showcase complex operations. Other examples (particularly involving time series) have an overabundance of data that make the critical results hard to spot. Frankly, my first month with Pandas was a miserable one.But I give the book 5 stars both because I came to love Pandas as I got more familiar with it, and because while McKinney is not fun to read, he does pack the book with useful information and it is (mostly) well organized. If anything it would benefit from being longer and with a more patient treatment of larger and more concrete datasets (eg the Titanic passenger dataset used in the Pandas documentation). The initial chapter on the basics of using Python could go - if you need this book, then you don't want to be trying to learn the rudiments of Python from it. If you can accept that you'll need a lot of bookmarks or margin notes to get through a rather steep learning curve, it will reward your persistence.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas NumPy and IPython
"This book has been my foundation of using python as a data analyst.This book primarily focuses on the pandas Python library, which is awesome at processing and organizing data (Python pandas is like MS Excel times 100. This is not an exaggeration). It also introduces the reader into numpy (lower level number crunching and arrays), matplotlib (data visualizations), scikitlearn (machine learning), and other useful data science libraries. The book contains other book recommendations for continuing education.Although this would be a challenging book for a brand new Python user, I would still recommend it, especially if you are currently doing a lot of work in MS Excel and/ or exporting data from databases. I had a few false starts learning Python, and my biggest stumbling block was lack of application in what I was learning. This book puts practical tools in the reader's hands very quickly. I personally don't have time to make goofy games etc. that other books have used as practice examples. Despite other reviews criticizing the use of random data throughout the book, I found the examples easy to follow and useful. I would also argue that learning how to generate random data is useful in itself (thus the purpose of the numpy random library), and that there are practical examples throughout the book. Chapter 14 devoted to real-world data analysis examples.I am almost finished with my second time through the book, this time working through every example. This book has been well worth the hours spent in it. For context, I previously relied on Excel, SQL, and some AutoHotKey.

Overall this is a decent starter book but you will have to bookmark the python and pandas documentation online if you want to have a reference to all of the functionality those tools have, and there are many places online where you can get better examples to learn from. If you haven't made your mind up about which tool to use for data analysis, I highly recommend checking out dplyr in R, which has an excellent free book online (R for data science, hadley wickham).

"There is a whole sub-culture of food porn, the lavish coffee table books that set out to educate you to an entire culture through its food. I once saw a library of several hundred.These are page flippers – doesn’t that look marvelous, we’ll have to try it next time we find halibut cheeks. The sad fact, though, is that any of these books are lucky if the owner actually uses one or two of its recipes and exalted if a recipe becomes a dinner party staple.The first edition of R Cookbook by Paul Teetor, published in 2011, was, in analogy, similar in that it provided flavors with good recipes, many of which proved useful for specific needs.The second edition, just out with J.D. Long as co-author retraces and updates much of the content of the first edition, brings RStudio and tidy tools to bear, and subverts the dominant paradigm. You flip through it and it first appears to be the cookbook equivalent of granny’s index card recipe box. But it starts off with enough new that you stop flipping pages and start reading.It took me two days to read the 554 pages. I had the help of several airplane hours, but it would have been a page turner anyway. What captivates is the rigorous R tutorial cleverly hidden in asides, call-out boxes and brief explanations of why a particular code chunk does one thing when you might reasonably expect another.In my childhood, Donald Duck had three nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie who got their uncle out of more than one jam by consulting The Junior Woodchuck Manual, which somehow contained the answer to any question that could possibly arise. The R Cookbook, 2ND Ed. comes close to that standard for the beginner to intermediate user who is completely innocent, on the one hand, or who has been covertly using functions without a well-founded understanding of their requirements and limitations.It would be an unconventional choice, perhaps, but this is the book that I would choose for the text if I were teaching a course in introductory R. Why? Because this book tells you what R does, not what it is. Any student coming to it with even an imprecise notion of f(x) = y is going to be able to follow along to the point, perhaps, of wanting to write her own package. The text doesn’t cover this, but points you in the right direction, and suggests source(“good_stuff.R”) as an interim step.In other words, its approach is like R’s, functional, not imperative, definitional not procedural. In my view, the implications in the R vs. Python wars are obvious. In one model, Professor Higgens tells Eliza bring me my slippers. In the other, he first has to declare a subject (the slippers), a possessive (my slippers), object (grammatical, me) and then, with the verb, provide detailed instructions on where they are to be found, how brought into possession and the means by which they are to be transported to their destination.Someone once said something to the effect that assembly language uses humans as pre-processors. I’m afraid that is true of many of its do-this, then do-that descendants.For now, their defense is the superiority of compiled programs in speed on the metal and the much more expensive wetware. And they are right for the one-off case. But as cases proliferate or become abstracted, wetware costs go up faster than throughput advantages.It will not happen while I’m still sentient enough to follow, but a compiled R or an R to Haskell API does seem to provide the best of both worlds. Put the wetware where it belongs, in defining the problem and the appropriate solution and leave the optimization to languages that are good at implementing functional logic.",5.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis Statistics and Graphics

In return you will get a solid understanding of R that is at an advanced beginner level.I teach an intro stats class, but to Honors students. So every semester I have a fairly large handful who want to go beyond the Excel and online sources we use in that beginning class to do more complex work. Sometimes this is just because they are interested, but often it is because they are working in labs and nobody knows how to do the stat. Excel does not cut it past a basic ANOVA so they come looking for more power (get it? Stats joke?) SPSS and SATS are just crazy expensive, and I see the writing on the wall that software is moving toward open source, like R so I try to encourage them in that direction.  I do not teach R in the class and so I need a sources the students can mainly use to learn on their own with a little help during office hours. I have been loaning out R for Dummies by de Vries and Learning R by Cotton out, I have the earlier R cookbook by Teetor alone but that book seemed only comprehensible to my really hard core STEM students and was getting a little long in the tooth. So I jumped at reviewing this version.I am still going to stick with loaning out R for Dummies to my softer science and non science students with less math and programming experiences. It holds their hands a little more and walks through RSudio more slowly. And does not throw around terms like functions and PERL and matrix so casually.  But this book is great for my STEM students with a little bit of determination and logic skills. I like the structure better than the previous book, it focuses more on actually understanding what you are doing  which in the long term is more useful than a bunch of tricks. Working through this book will result in a pretty solid understanding of the basics in R and a bit past that as well.This book mostly assumes you understand the underlying statistics, which is fine, I doubt those who do not are going to be venturing into programming in R.",5.0 out of 5 stars,R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis Statistics and Graphics

"This is my current favorite ""general"" book on Excel.  There are a few other books on specific features of Excel (such as Tables, PowerQuery, and VBA) that I would probably rank slightly higher as they provide more depth on their specific areas.  But this book touches a lot of topics while staying very practical.  There are numerous features, tips, and warnings that intermediate and advanced Excel users will benefit from.My only complaint is that the book is printed in black & white.  Some images would benefit from being in color or at a minimum more nuanced shading as the background theme is quite dark.  While annoying on some images, this does not detract from the overall usefulness of the book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Guerrilla Data Analysis Using Microsoft Excel: Overcoming Crap Data and Excel Skirmishes

"Professionally, I work a lot with quantitative data, through mathematics/biostatistics, building software, and research design. The world of words has long been a domain that has enchanted me even though symbols have comprised my main language. Recently, my wife has started graduate work using qualitative methods. I decided to fill my deficits in this world by reading this book. I am by no means expert or even experienced in it, but I merely have an interest.This book seems to be the seminal work in its field. The authors share their wisdom and experiences in this accessible textbook, now in a fourth edition. They cover the entire process from design and data collection to building a theory. They talk at length about coding as well as how to present your data. They even have a chapter on writing, with many encouragements to not be boring!The graphics and illustrations in this book are excellent and inspirational. I am always interested in creating visualizations to communicate research data effectively, and this book provided many muses in that regard. They talked about converting written accounts into concept maps and linking those to address “influences and affects” of a weak sort of causality. This book helped slow my mind down about the many moving parts in qualitative research so that I can focus more on a work’s reality and substance.This book is obviously geared towards researchers, whether new or old. The writing and presentation are accessible enough so that graduate students would be well-served by reading this work. Practitioners, of course, can benefit as well, but they likely would have read one of the prior three editions of this book. Those who, like me, are involved in other parts of the research enterprise can learn about their colleagues’ work, too. Finally, those who spend significant time building visuals to communicate concepts can learn from these authors’ analytical techniques.After finishing this work, I’m inspired about the myriad of ways non-quantitative data can be analyzed and concisely communicated to readers – especially in ways that aren’t written prose. Poetry, artful presentations, summarizing graphics, and matrix-tables together can create a mosaic to comport meaningful and accurate understanding to readers. My personal bar has been raised, and I suspect many other readers’ bars will be, too.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Qualitative Data Analysis: A Methods Sourcebook

"Experiencia en estudios de posgrado (versión impresa, pasta blanda)Cada situación es única. La mía al menos, fue carecer de formación y experiencia previa en procesos de análisis de datos cualitativos para mostrar un desempeño competente a nivel posgrado. Llegó el momento en el que resultó necesario ir más allá de lo que la universidad pública estatal podía ofrecer, tanto en recursos (dado su limitado acceso a un acervo básico de libros actualizados en el tema y la limitación de acceso a bases de datos electrónicas) como en orientación inmediata. Es aquí donde el libro de Análisis Cualitativo de Datos de Miles, Huberman & Saldaña (2020) en su cuarta edición ilumina las posibilidades.Acostumbrado a la oferta competente de productos editados por Sage (no todos, pero sí la mayoría), la posibilidad de leer previamente el índice y algo del contenido en línea a través de Google Libros, me convenció de que sería una buena guía... y no me defraudó.Con un lenguaje accesible, siempre abierto a considerar que cada caso de investigación es único y que los contenidos presentados son sugerencias resultado de experiencias profesionales (pero no por eso recetas únicas de cómo proceder), el libro guía al lector a través de tres etapas para: 1) Tener una idea básica, pero amplia de lo que implica el análisis de datos cualitativos, 2) Cómo manejar los datos obtenidos en términos de: exploración, descripción, ordenamiento, explicación y predicción y 3) Cómo obtener y verificar las conclusiones obtenidas.Al ser una edición actualizada (al momento de esta reseña al menos), el contenido contempla un elenco de herramientas tecnológicas especializadas para el análisis de datos con funciones que permitan agilizar su procesamiento (recordando siempre que son solo eso, herramientas, no sustitutos del procesamiento intelectual que corresponde al investigador).Con una lógica de ""Descripción --> aplicaciones --> Ejemplo(s)"", el libro asegura la facilidad de comprensión para casi todos los casos que presenta. Las ilustraciones y tablas que acompañan sus explicaciones, son sencillas de seguir e interpretar como ejemplos.Opté por la versión impresa dado que, aunque la edición digital es más ""accesible"" en costo, eventualmente depende de dispositivos electrónicos para su consulta, algo que no siempre resulta benéfico a largo plazo (habrá a quienes les resulte indistinto el formato, pero yo lo he intentado y las versiones impresas facilitan más mi concentración). Tal vez, buscando maximizar las ganancias y reducir costos, en la versión impresa el formato del libro es relativamente grande y las letras de tamaño pequeño (como un Times New Roman de 10 pts. aprox.), resultando en un formato poco práctico para su manejo. Comparativamente ""The Coding manual for cualitative resarches"" (Saldaña, 2021), tiene un poco más de páginas pero su tamaño de formato resulta mucho más práctico de manejar.El gran pero es el precio que, en México al menos, son palabras mayores (alrededor de USD$80.00 al tipo de cambio el día de la reseña). Ojalá que este tipo de publicaciones, que bien podrían ser libros de texto para mejorar el proceso de investigadores/as en formación, tuvieran un costo más accesible sin tener que optar por versiones digitales.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Qualitative Data Analysis: A Methods Sourcebook

"I did not find the information in the book to be of the value paid.-In an attempt to keep the book as relevant for as long as possible, the author made vague instructions for each command and purposely avoided more complicated issues that can arise. You would expect a book about data analysis to get a little more in depth and complicated.-You can also tell the book was written at different times for each command, there was no natural flow to the book, like you were getting a different author on each page/subject. Although he did say in the beginning of the book that it was pretty much as such.-As my headline says, this is a book of commands with recycled info.

I like the this book and how it combines SQL queries with Excel data analysis.

I'm running SQL Server on a Mac and I think the author did all his work on a Windows-based PC.  My suggestion would be to devote a chapter or two in the next edition explaining how to get started with SQL Server in BOTH Windows and OS X environments.  It's always been my experience that the 'devil is in the details' and I fear that laptop compatibility issues are going to hamper my ability to absorb the great information in this book.Am I the only one who is having this trouble?

"I buy a copy of this book for each new hire in my small analytics group. My most recent purchase was of the Second Edition which is a noticeable improvement on the excellent First Edition which I have already reviewed very favorably. Many of the queries have been reworked to be more readable by using common table expressions. The index is better which is important because I often tell someone something like ""There's a great example of using window functions for that somewhere in Linoff's book"" and now they have a better chance of finding the example I have in mind.  There is also a welcome new chapter on performance issues. The most important strength of this book remains the same: It shows SQL the way it is actually used for business analysis. I don't think there is a single INSERT or UPDATE statement in the book, and that's fine because we rarely use them in our line of work. On the other hand, there are many examples of things we do all the time such as creating histograms to explore distributions, creating lookup tables, and calculating distance or similarity.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis Using SQL and Excel

"Felix Zumstein (FZ), the author of ""Python for Excel"" (PfE), is an excellent technical writer. Throughout the book he strikes the perfect balance between brief, clear and informative. In the genre of technical writing, PfE is the nearest thing to a page-turner I've encountered. I can honestly say I learned something significant, interesting and useful on nearly every page of the book.Part I, Part II and the three appendices cover Python and the powerful pandas data analysis package. As an experienced coder with little prior exposure to Python, I found these sections of the book to be quick and easy to read, and I'm now using them as a reference that I turn to again and again as I bolster my Python skills. If you're looking to get up to speed with Python, I believe you'll find PfE to be a great resource, even if you don't plan to use Excel or VBA in your work.Part III and Part IV cover the bidirectional integration of Python with Excel and VBA, and usage of the xlwings package to simplify this complicated task. As an experienced Excel + VBA developer with considerable prior exposure to cross-platform work, I find using PfE + xlwings to integrate with Python to be a relative cakewalk. If you're looking to integrate Python with Excel and VBA, I believe PfE + xlwings is the way to go, and I strongly recommend them to you.I'll close by sharing some information about me for context. I've been developing quantitative models/applications for a long time, and I have considerable experience coding with C/C++, C# and S-Plus/R, and a lot of experience coding with VBA for Excel. As far as Python goes, though, I had only dabbled with it before now. I have a few Python books on my bookshelf, but none of them had inspired me to take the plunge and really learn it. Then PfE came along and, because I'm an avid Excel user and developer, I was excited to buy a copy and dive headlong into Python. PfE proved to be a tremendously worthwhile investment for me, both in terms of the nominal cost of the book and in terms of the considerable time to work through it. Python is now an indispensable tool in my coding tool kit; I've started developing a Python-powered Excel workbook add-in of my own, and I'm confident it will greatly streamline my quantitative development and quantitative analysis efforts in the very near future and for many years to come. Thank you FZ for sharing your incredible work with me, by way of the book and by way of xlwings.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Excel: A Modern Environment for Automation and Data Analysis
"This is a great introduction for industry based professionals looking for an introduction to Python for Excel. The author does an excellent job explaining Python fundamentals as they relate to common/intermediate excel functions. I highly recommend this book to professionals (especially managers and above) that interested in the benefits/limitations of Python programming for excel. If you’d like to learn the basics of Python and how the language can be used as a source of process improvement on your workflows, then this is for you.If you’re someone who has advanced experience in Python, data processing, and automated workflows, then you might benefit from reading through the following issues to see if this is the right book for you.1. A majority of the examples from the book load data stored in Excel based file format. There’s very little information on how Python can be used to load, clean, process, and convert flat files (csv, txt, dat, etc). Most data intensive automated processes interact with flat files, and it’s the most common file type used to import data. It was surprising to find that there wasn’t at least a chapter on preparing/importing data to Excel with Python. This is the main reason why I couldn’t give the book 5 stars.2. A lot of the more advanced topics/examples use custom packages (such as the parallel_pandas package). For more intermediate-advanced concepts, such as parallelization, they use functions built into these custom packages and leave out in-depth detains on how the code actually works.3. The major automation examples in this book uses xlwings. Xlwings is undeniable an incredible package, but by design, it’s main use is for building interactive applications in excel. This book may not be as helpful for you if you’re using an alternative excel package for non-interactive automated processes that function with task schedulers.All in all this is a great book for any business professional/data scientist that works with Excel on a regular basis. Despite the issues I noted, it’s one of the most comprehensive books about Python for Excel on the market.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Excel: A Modern Environment for Automation and Data Analysis

The author does a great job of guiding you carefully through the journey assuming only basic Excel knowledge.  Also, the book explains the reasoning behind why using Python is a superior choice to VBA and how it can be used to replace the functionality of most native Excel data analysis tools.

"This is a great reference book filled with many helpful code snippets. There are many insightful hints and tricks in the book, things I did not know even though I have used Python and Pandas for a while. I have read and owned many Time Series Analysis/Forecasting textbooks, mostly filled with R code, making it hard to transition or translate these concepts into Python. There are few Python Time Series books out there, these are great resources to understand the concepts within Time Series Analysis/Forecasting, but they lack proper code implementation (and explanations) to show how things work and the best way to implement them. I think this cookbook fills that gap between the different academic textbooks so you can feel comfortable in developing solutions that can be used in a real-world setting. It takes you from theory to hands-on implementation and many valuable hints to take things further.I liked the balance between ML, DL, and Statistical Methods, but also a fair amount of Data Engineering (how to read/write to Snowflake, AWS Redshift, InfluxDB, Cloud storage, and working with SAS files ..etc.). As a reference book, I find that it can be very beneficial for me in the future as it covers a wide range of topics, the entire end-to-end process, from data pipeline, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preparation for ML, and development models using ARIMA, SARIMA, VAR, UCM, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.The recipes do a great job comparing different methods and guide you to different evaluation techniques for univariate, multivariate, multiple-seasonality, and other types of time series data. One of the chapters does a great job comparing ML/DL, Prophet, with classical statistical methods, which I thought was pretty insightful.Overall highly recommended.

It has the code snippets required for smooth learning and links to dataset on GitHub to play around.As a Data analyst, I am familiar with stats/python/modeling to an extent but this book has really helped me to deliver on my project the past few months. In a way, this book is written to guide you through a project step by step. Starts with how to read the data, handle missing values, Outlier detection, EDA, multiple modeling techniques depending on your data and complexity. The mathematics are presented briefly and appropriately for each topics, not overloading your brain with information.And that is why I would recommend this book as it’s a widely used topics and this book can be used not only as a starting point but also as a reference point while working on a time series project.PS- It explains how to set up a virtual environment",5.0 out of 5 stars,Time Series Analysis with Python Cookbook: Practical recipes for exploratory data analysis data preparation forecasting and model evaluation
"I've read a few ML time-series books. One thing I look for is practicality as well as explaining difficult and advanced concepts. This book does a pretty good job for walking somebody through the process. I appreciate the visuals, the code, as well as all the technical depth in all the different models. I would definitely recommend this to an experienced practicioner to increase their skills.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Time Series Analysis with Python Cookbook: Practical recipes for exploratory data analysis data preparation forecasting and model evaluation
"As I ventured into the world of Data Science, I realized more and more Data Science use cases in the real world are based on Time Series or some form of date/time. For example, forecasting models and anomaly detection.I usually refer to various Time Series books (mainly textbooks) to learn more about Time Series. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there is a book that is dedicated Python Cookbook for Time Series! I was hoping to find one for Python. The book dives into the topic with explicit details, and every recipe hits on such essential topics. Most importantly, and my interest, is the code and how the code works. The author Tarek Atwan seems to be quite knowledgeable and passionate in this area, and it shows up in each chapter where he goes through each core concept using theory, followed by hands-on coding examples and in-depth explanations of the code. I enjoyed the ""There is more"" section for each recipe; very informative. I found this book quite helpful and use it as a reference whenever I want to understand a particular topic or gain confidence in this area. Highly recommended!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Time Series Analysis with Python Cookbook: Practical recipes for exploratory data analysis data preparation forecasting and model evaluation
"Overall, the cookbook is not just a compilation of codes but it also includes some explanation of when and how the codes. I am impressed by how comprehensive the examples in the book are. The cookbook belongs in the toolbox of every dataset science practitioner working on time series-related projects.There are examples of code of how to visualize time series, how to detect stationarity and how to transform non-stationary time series.The cookbook has a lot of useful examples on how to handle missing data including simple imputer and iterative imputer. It explains when to use statistical methods such as z-score and modified z-score for outlier detection. It also has examples of how to use unsupervised learning for outlier detection. These code examples include how to use KNN, LOF, iForest, one-class SVM, COPOD, and PyCaret. There are example codes on how to perform time series forecasting using ARIMA, Facebook prophet, and sequential deep learning such as RNN, GRU, and LSTM.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Time Series Analysis with Python Cookbook: Practical recipes for exploratory data analysis data preparation forecasting and model evaluation
"This book is a must have for anyone looking to forecast with Python. Whether you are just starting or a seasoned professional, Tarek provides a comprehensive guide that addresses today’s forecasting challenges.If only this book had existed when I first started; as you are beginning your journey, you’ll get step-by-step recipes that progressively build through each chapter from setting up your environment to tuning your models. As a Python user who works on forecasting every day, I learned a lot about advanced forecasting methods such as multivariate time series, deep learning for time series, and outlier detection using unsupervised learning.TL;DR: Overall: 5/5 stars, easy read, I would highly recommend this book to all interested in leveling up their forecasting.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Time Series Analysis with Python Cookbook: Practical recipes for exploratory data analysis data preparation forecasting and model evaluation

If you’re a bad reader like me and more of hands on person, then you need to look no further as this book is definitely for you, the book focuses on illustrating how and when to use codes clearly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Time Series Analysis with Python Cookbook: Practical recipes for exploratory data analysis data preparation forecasting and model evaluation
"If you are looking for a hands-on in depth coverage of time series analysis, then this is the right book for you.The approach of a cookbook is a perfect fit for this subject. The focus is on hands on learning with full examples for each topic that will help the reader understand and experiment with the topic discussed. As a visual learner this approach works better for me than a book that tries to be academic and wastes pages on unnecessary explanations of trivial topics only to leave little space for some scattered code that will not help fully piece and understand the topic.This book is intended for those who are already familiar with python so no time is wasted explaining the basics. Instead you start with quick introduction to important libraries through examples and quick exercises on using virtual environments using conda or venv.After that the pace quickens and you deep dive into advanced topics like outlier detection, statistical methods, plotting, forecasting, transformations to more complicated topics like deep learning and machine learning.Each chapter is independent so you can skip to the chapter of interest and all the steps needed to run that recipe are in that chapter.I was pleasantly surprised with the depth of topics the book went through like the section on Unobserved Components Model (UCM).This is a very valuable book to keep in your library for later references. Having the examples to work through helps solidify the concepts and you will find yourself going back to these recipes when needed.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Time Series Analysis with Python Cookbook: Practical recipes for exploratory data analysis data preparation forecasting and model evaluation

It also covers using exponents or additional multiplications to use as second variables, not just another variable with a coefficient. So I give it 5 stars because it takes these steps from basic to more complex. I was hoping it had the math or explained more about the equation of when using continuous variable with a categorical variable. Using categorical in a linear regression is a unique scenario, according to trying to find help online about this. Every chapter is useful and I plan to keep it for reference to evaluate a model.

"I'm new to project leadership so I've been trying to read at least one book about managing, data, and design every month to get fresh ideas about how to do my work and where to take my career (hence my new Goodreads shelf, tech-boss-babe-reading-list). STORYTELLING WITH DATA went on sale recently for $4.99 and I decided to snap it up since graphs and charts aren't exactly my strongest point as someone who tends to be more verbal and less mathematically inclined.Some of the complaints for this book are that it teaches the basics. That might be disappointing for people who take to this sort of thing easily or have been doing it for years, but for newbies like me, it's really great. I like how the author included ""before"" and ""after"" examples, as well as examples of what ""good"" and ""bad"" displays of data look like.My one complaint is that she doesn't really talk about tools. She says it's to make the stuff he talks about more relevant to everyone, by keeping things simple, and she does link to templates and other sources that give more in-depth how-tos with specific software, but I guess I was kind of hoping for a ""Graphing on Excel for Dummies"" checklist, so I will admit to being a little disappointed.Overall, though, this has some really great lists of what to do and what not to do and it will help people who do not think abstractly or mathematically tell ""stories"" with data in a way that makes sense.3.5 to 4 out of 5 stars",4.0 out of 5 stars,Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals
"There is some good stuff in here.I like Knaflic’s focus on intentionality. For her, the defaults are something that should be avoided, or at least justified.I like how she looks at the presentation of graphic information as a story arc. There is one thing that you want to focus on to create actionable decisions. This is best, as she describes, if you are presenting. There are limitations if you have a static document that has information for multiple stakeholders.The book is accessibly written with a clean font and plenty of examples.However, I do have to push back a bit. She follows Tufte in trying to eliminate data ink. Part of the intentionality is that you have less and less information on the page and every thing you includes helps tell your story. For me though that leads to a sameness. You want your audience to not have to think so hard. You want to make sure they don’t have their eyes glaze over. But that means that everything is very simple with a muted palette. The author notes that some of these are just her preference, but the mode of thinking has become influential. Part of me wants my audience to do some work in understanding the text I put in front of them. It means a level of engagement that I worry a too-simple graph leaves out.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals

"Too many times, data presented in charts and graphs do not express specific information. The creation of these charts and graphs misses the point of creating them in the first place.In Storytelling with Data, the author provides insights on how to utilize graphs and charts to tell a story with your data. The book focuses on several areas to consider when developing storytelling visuals:- Awareness of Context — Be aware of who will be viewing the visual, what they need to know, what they already know.- Choose an Effective Visual — What type of visual will best deliver your point.- Limiting Clutter — Leaving out details that do not add something valuable and making secondary items fade into the background, so they are still available but are not the main focus.- Focus Audience Attention — Make the essential information of the visual stand out the most through the use of color, spatial layout, and other strategies.- Think Like a Designer — Keep principles of good design in mind and take the time to make your visuals appealing.The book goes through each of these points in detail with many before and after examples to show (not just tell) how focusing on certain design aspects can make a huge difference in getting your point across.I would highly recommend Storytelling with Data to anyone who creates visuals to display details of data.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals

"I work in the project controls arena of large projects that have hundreds, if not thousands of people working on them. A key requirement for project controls is to keep all project personnel informed about the project status. Needless to say engineering plays a major role on these projects and brings lots of data with them; pages and pages of it. As the author points out the analytical types are not necessarily trained on how to tell a story (i.e. communicate) with their data.For the last 10 years or so, I have developed methods for getting the project story down to a single graphic. It's usually a large graphic, but a single one. It has the effect of getting everyone on the same page. But for people who are not used to looking at this type of presentation, it can be overwhelming or as the author points out they have to work at it in order to understand it. This was a key point for me.Before I finished the book, I started making changes in my work products. They were small changes, but the feedback was very positive. One example, do you ever note information in page footers like date, time and maybe filename and path? Does anyone think to put them in the background by using a shade of gray instead of the default black? No! Try it. Then ask for opinions It doesn't sound like much, but it's reducing the competition on people's focus.This book is great! It's fairly short to read and has a lot of examples making it easy to follow the author's intent. She obviously is very good at her profession. If I had to pick one book as a recommendation to someone who wants to learn about making great presentation graphics, I will point to this book. I highly recommend it.

"R in Action does an excellent job showing the power of the R language. The book also serves a way to learn statistics and data science through using the R language.At the beginning the examples are practical, showing how to make graphs based off data sets that come packaged with R. Sometimes packages are required to install to get the examples running, and the author is clear about how to do this.In chapter eight there was an excellent description about Regression analysis. I knew what regressions were, but this explanation helped clear up some confusion I had. The author says (p.167): ""It's [regression analysis] a broad term for a set of methodologies used to predict a response variable (also called a dependent, criterion, or outcome variable) from one or more predictor variables (also called independent or explanatory variables).Following this explanation is a concrete example given showing how to predict the number of calories a person burns on a treadmill based off different factors. I liked that the author defined all the terms, and then gave a concrete example. It is a pattern throughout the book that worked very well.The later parts of the book briefly dive in machine learning and more advanced data science concepts.The main focus of the book is on statistics, graphing, and plotting. This worked well, because it shows the areas where R shines compared with other languages. Luckily for the reader the author knows which techniques work well, and states when certain data analysis techniques work better than others. The author remains humble throughout, stating when he finds a topic complex.R in Action is a great resource for learning R and learning statistics. Explanations transition from easy to hard in a logical manner and this book will be useful for data scientists of all experience levels.",5.0 out of 5 stars,R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R
"I have read quite a few books on R, and will rate this as perhaps one of the best if not the best. The author has explained the material with excellent clarity, the examples are relevant to real-world applications, and the code executes well using either base installation of R (with added packages) or R studio. Also, the author has managed to concurrently develop both data analysis and data visualization (graphing), which helps the reader, and exposes the capabilities of R very well. The range of topics covered in this book is very broad and gives a good overview of the field. As a clinician with interest in epidemiology, I found almost everything needed for beginner or intermediate level applications. Also, if one works through this book diligently, s/he will be in a very good position to follow more advanced topics (like multilevel models) from other resources.I have only one issue with the book (which is a generic issue with most statistics or data science books centered around a software). That is, it contains very little, if any, mathematical basis or details of the methods being discussed. These days, statistics is taught ""thorough"" a software. Hence, it is artificial to separate mathematical statistics from computational aspects. I am waiting for a book which will start with the mathematical aspects including derivations of the theorems/equations, give examples of real world applications, and illustrate the application in R.One minor issue is related to very poor quality of the binding of the book. In the copy that I received, perhaps the pasting was defective, and as soon as I first opened it, the first page tore off. Soon, the binding opened up and pages/sections started falling off. I am not sure if this is just limited to the copy that I got or is a systemic issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars,R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R

""R in Action"" is thorough, clearly written, written in a logical order, it gives examples for everything, and it even gives 3 ways to do the same thing if applicable.  As a beginning data scientist, I know that this book will be sitting on my desk and have many tabs in it to mark the places where I don't quite have the material memorized.

Seems like it's going to be a great reference to have on hand at all times when putting R into practice with research. The one thing (thus far) I am disappointed with is that the code for graphs isn't complete -- frequently will say that the following code produces graph #xyz. However, the code really only produces the most basic version of the graph in the book, and they don't include the extra code for ACTUALLY reproducing (which would be handy if new to graphs and trying to figure out some basic formatting manipulations without a lot of work)",5.0 out of 5 stars,R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R

The author does a great job explaining statistical concepts. I would recommend this book to practitioners and teachers alike for that reason. Those focusing on statistical analysis (statistics) or data mining would enjoy this book. It doesn't cover more advance concepts in-depth like some books I have read, but that isn't this book's goal.

"Prof. Lesa Hoffman has written an excellent book on longitudinal data analysis, as simple as that, and this is the strength of the book. It covers all main topics of longitudinal analysis from the most basic to the most complex cases, but Prof. Hoffman develops a methodology that simplifies this tough issue by means of examples, illustrations, and clear explanations. One major advantage of this book is its proposed formats for reports. As data analysts, we always struggle with these dilemmas of what to report and how to report it. Prof. Hoffman solves this problem by offering the right content of a report on longitudinal analysis results that meets top publication requirements.

"This is a comprehensive book on longitudinal models for within person fluctuation and change, with an applied emphasis. That doesn’t mean the book shies away from theory; it’s just that you wont see matrix algebra on every other page. In fact, nothing other than an elementary understanding of algebra, matrices and some basic high school math is required to grasp the necessary theoretical background. The book also provides syntax and code for SAS, STATA, SPSS and Mplus, and example datasets (real and simulated) on a companion website———————————————————Content Summary: The book starts off with an overview (big picture) of all the topics to be discussed.The next chapter provides a comprehensive review of the general linear model (between person analysis).Then you get a prelude to longitudinal models by introducing within person analysis (univariate and multivariate ANOVAs), and techniques for making model comparisons.After this, within person fluctuation is discussed with alternative covariance structures.Random effects for time and model estimation are introduced next as we start getting into within person change.The next chapter delves deeper into exploring within person change by modeling non linear trends using polynomial, exponential, logistic models and piecewise models.After this, Time invariant predictors are discussed with an appendix on evaluating assumptions about model residuals (very useful).There’s also an appendix in chapter 6 which goes over a complete checklist for building unconditional models of within person change, which is very important. To set up before including time varying and between person predictors. Many chapter have such useful appendices.This is as far as i have read (used only lectures and notes for further topics), but for completeness: The next 2 chapters discuss time varying predictors for fluctuation and change, followed by a further section with 4 chapters on advanced applications.————————————————————————————What i liked about this book:1) Each topic is introduced with thorough explanation and justification along with the underlying theory. There is a whole section on model estimation in one chapter.2) Concepts have a flow and connectedness to them; each chapter builds on the previous ones3) (Important) the author mentions caveats, drawbacks and alternatives for the methods introduced throughout the book, with due concern for assumptions of these methods. This is something i really liked about the book and is present throughout4) Examples are clear and the author runs through the analysis output for them in every chapter with discussion of practical concerns5) Tables and easy to understand visualizations are used appropriately (There’s a really nice chart for ACS models that shows how they’re related)6) The book takes an integrated approach where the applications of longitudinal models are discussed as particular instances of a more general frameworkIt’s not an easy task to write a readable and comprehensive book on such a topic without bombarding the reader with matrix algebra and mathematical statistics on every other page, so expect the book to be wordy (it is unavoidable). I liked it and will be using it in the future for the topics i haven’t covered yet.Readers should also note that the author has recordings of her class lectures on her YouTube channel, which follow the book closely with plenty of extra nuggets of wisdom.

"This is a serious book for serious people.  If you are a newbie to econometrics, look elsewhere.  But then, if you were a newbie, you probably would not be reading reviews for this book.Anyway, this volume is the leading and, in my view, the best treatise on econometrics involving panel data.  I worked through various chapters of it as part of a Ph.D. level class on advanced econometrics.  (No, I have not read the entire book, and I have never met anyone who claimed that (s)he did.)This book requires(1) a solid grounding in linear algebra (""matrices"")(2) a very solid grounding in econometrics(3) a very substantial amount of spare timeOn the plus side, the author has a skill for elegant and clear writing.  He is also one of the leading experts on many of the topics covered, and it shows.  For many of the topics, I have not been able to find a clearer and more useful treatment elsewhere.On the downside, you will occasionally have to consult other materials as well, especially research papers.  This should not surprise you.  If you are interested in econometrics at the level covered in this treatise, then you know that econometrics is an evolving science, and you can never get the absolute cutting-edge research from any treatise.

"Wooldridge gives enough detail for the intellectual student to fully understand the underlying basis of the theory. The material is concise enough to be simple to the eye, yet (as long as one can read linear algebra), steps left out do not take long to work out by hand. Having read ""Introduction to Econometrics"" before this, Wooldridge is my preferred choice of author, as I find it easy to understand his writing. I consider a work such the present one to be essential background knowledge for the practicing econometrician.All the topics relevant to cross-sectional data are included (OLS, FGLS, dealing with heteroskedasticity or serial correlation, IV, MLE, probit/logit models, etc.), in a more rigorous way than ""Introduction to Econometrics"", in addition to panel topics. Linear algebra is used to simplify the notation.Compared to more elementary texts, the typography is more bland and traditional, but that's probably because the target audience is narrower and more serious. A Times serif font is used for both the text and the math.I can't say much now about what material is omitted, but I'll see if I can update this review in a few years' time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data second edition (The MIT Press)

I highly recommend PhD students in econ and finance (and other quantitative disciplines) buying the copy, as the 1st edition pdf available online is not the same.

I cannot imagine using this book as an introductory textbook even at the doctoral level.  This book is invaluable for someone who already has a good understanding of econometrics and wants a lot of detail and guidance in one place.  I wouldn't want to live without it.

The amount of time it takes to get a tidbit from this book is very long, because it is too wordy, and pretty much most times uses terminology out of the blue - terminology that has not been explained earlier. Also, this book tends to often not explain the ""why"" of several procedures, thereby leaving the reader to only second guess as to what might be the reason for doing that the author is recommending....As much as I respect Prof. Wooldridge's efforts, I actually find Cameron and Trivedi's book easier to follow, and quicker to glean inferences from.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data second edition (The MIT Press)

"This is a very thorough and authoritative treatment of regression methods for analyzing count data. It is very current and covers many topics not commonly found in books on point processes. Economic applications are emphasized but the broader applicability of the methods is eluded to.The authors intent is for this book to be read by researchers, graduate students and practitioners in the many fields that make use of count data. Chapter 1 introduces count data, the Poisson distribution and the Poisson process and also shows how the Poisson process can be derived based on the assumption of independent and identically distributed exponential waiting times. It concludes with specification of regression models for counts and a number of practical examples where modeling count data would naturally arise. The importance of the integers is emphasized with the quote from Kronecker at the beginning of the chapter, ""God made the integers, all the rest is the work of man.""Chapter 2 provides an extensive treatment of model specification and estimation methods. The authors cover many approaches and provide excellent references to the literature. Generalized linear models provide one common approach in the statistics literature and these methods are well described in this chapter.Poisson regression is the main topic of Chapter 3 but the chapter goes on to discuss negative binomial models that handle overdispersion. An example of data on doctor's visits is used to illustrate the techniques. Statistical tests for overdispersion are also presented. A variety of other modeling techniques are also provided.More general models including mixture models are considered in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 looks at ways of evaluating potential models. Chapter 6 provides some real economic data from health services to illustrate the methods of the earlier chapters.Chapter 7 covers time series analysis for integer data. The authors provide information and literature that is not standard in a text on time series analysis but is applicable to count data.Subsequent chapters deal with more complexity including multivariate data,longitudinal data analysis and measurement error models. Important recent developments in bootstrap methods and Bayesian statistics are covered in the context of problems for which these methods have demonstrated their value.This is a great reference book for statisticians and econometricians interested in problems involving counting processes.

"This is an excellent read for scientists and engineers who are interested in approaching data analysis from the perspective of making predictions using probability density functions (pdf) informed from the state of one's knowledge. In other words, the simple math behind Bayes theorem and marginalization gives rise to probability predictions using likelihood (data model) pdf, prior (i.e, best guess of degrees of freedom in the model) pdf, and if needed, evidence/marginal  (domain of model) pdf.  The book essential  discusses this in a few different areas, namely:Single Parameter estimation, ex., probability of the mean of some data setMulti-parameter estimationModel comparison, ex., the probability that M parameters describe data.Selecting pdf and MaxEntropy, i.e., which pdf provides the most information for given data.Inference, i.e., functional model  estimationLeast-squaresComputational approaches to the calculation of posterior pdfThe first several chapters in the book are more of a survey and primer than a workbook, it gets you thinking about how to do data analysis from a probabilistic standpoint and provides some case studies/examples but doesn't give much of the ""mechanics"" for how to do things except for the last few chapters.Overall a good first book to read with regard to Bayesian methods.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial
"This is a truly excellent text; it differentiates clearly between conventional statistical and probabilistic methods, and those unique to the Bayesian tradition(s). It provides clear examples, and walks the reader through procedures that might otherwise be most opaque. The authors' intentions are clearly to expound a tradition of academic and scientific excellence, rather than simply to produce a textbook for graduate students to work from.Possible cons: This material is not easy to pick up. The authors make it as lucid as I, as a self-motivated student and researcher, can imagine it being in a text, but it is simply not easy material to work with. That being the case, one potential objection might be that in some cases the reader may not understand WHY a particular technique is important to use in the manner it is being described without significant reflection.Cons aside: I recommend this book very highly to any serious student of probability and/or statistics, and to any mathematician or computer scientist who wants to expand her/his horizons and capabilities. It is possible that an advanced student of Bayesian methods might find most of the material in the book familiar, but it is unlikely that she/he will have learned ALL of it, or have a reference book readily available that is so clear about every topic included as this one. It is also uniquely affordable, for such a significant purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial
"As a physics student I was frustrated by statistics with its apparent lack of conceptual foundation and the toolbox approach to data analysis.  A little more than 15 years ago, I picked up the first edition of this book and learned Bayesian data analysis from it.  The topic is introduced from a practical perspective designed for someone who wants to use these methods for data analysis applied to real problems.  This relatively small book clearly, cogently, and pleasantly covers the concepts, the theory and practice.  I was pleased to be able to use this text to guide me in applying Bayesian data analysis methods to my own problems.  Today, as an experienced practitioner, I find myself still referring to it.For the last seven years, I have taught an upper level undergraduate/graduate level course on Bayesian Data Analysis in the physics and computer science departments at the University at Albany (SUNY).

Very similar in scope to Abu Mostafa's book learning from data, to the book of  Hastie, Tibshirani, James and Witten intro to statistical learning, or to Andrew Ng's Coursera machine learning intro course.  Lots more math than those courses but that's to be expected for a book on Bayesian learning.  There are lots of fully worked out examples in this book.  The amount of math may make it hard for the less mathematically inclined reader to follow the examples.

Especially helpful is the authors' practice of treating several variations of a single problem, such as: ""Here's how we'd analyze the data if we knew X and Y; later, we'll treat the case where we have to estimate X; finally, we'll treat a general case where we must estimate both.""Highly recommended, both for its content and as an example of how to teach a subject that's unfamiliar to most readers.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial

"I read this book as the text in a four-week online class on cluster analysis.  I learned a great deal and do not regret purchasing this book.  It has several strengths and some weaknesses as an introduction to this statistical technique.There is a good introduction to the unsupervised learning problem of classifying objects into meaningful groups with no basis for validating these classifications.  The authors' decision to focus on graphical methods early in the text is a good one and lays an intuitive foundation for their more technical presentation later in the book.  The discussion of similarity measures at the core of cluster analysis is a good overview and prepares readers for more advanced discussions elsewhere.The book closes with the highly useful and practical chapter ""Some final comments and guidelines.""  It lists and describes nine steps in a typical cluster analysis and refers readers back to sections of the book which inform the decisions at each step.  It's coverage of methods for testing cluster quality and the likelihood of no structure in a dataset is also accessible and of practical value.  Readers might consider looking through this material before reading the previous chapters to help organize the information more meaningfully.The middle chapters are worth reading, but suffer from a few problems.  In general, these chapters are better at describing the boundaries of current research in clustering techniques than they are in describing typical applications.  There are too many research results and not enough examples.  The examples that are included are described too briefly, making it difficult to follow how the analysis was carried out.  Better integration of citations in the body of the text would be a key improvement.  As would inclusion of sample exercises with worked-out solutions in an appendix.Recognizing the difficulty of making a statistics text accessible to readers using a variety of software packages, I still believe this was not done well in this book.

If obviously goes into greater detail including more than a few formulas, but it reads fairly well.  I still don't think that more than a handful of the folks I work with in need this much detail, and a serious practitioner might need even more.  Kachigan's chapter on this topic would be more relevant to a wide audience.

"I purchased the digital version of this book to use as a reference while working in Pandas. The content that I have seen is good. It goes into a lot of scenarios a lot of other training and how to's don't cover.However, what could be construed as a TOC is located in the Preface and the chapters are not linked. It has no links for organization or ease of use anywhere that I have come across. There is an index, but no link to get to the index, so you have to create a book mark or just remember. It's on page 598 by the way. This is almost a deal breaker. I may return this and look for another reference. It's a shame.Finally, the digital version does not format well at all on my Kindle Fire.

"Disclaimer: The publisher and author each asked me to review this book and gave me a review copy. I promise to be 100% honest in how I feel about this book, both the good and the less so.Overview:This might be my favorite data science reference book yet.  It takes you from zero to pandas master in a very short time.  The top 99% of what you need to know to use pandas for all of your data science and AI needs are in this book.  It is well laid out and packs in the needed detail.What I Like:This book is very well organized, which is a major factor I look for in technical books.  You have the typical section on how to get set up, followed by the very basics so that the author and reader speak a common pandas language going forward.  Then the author distills a basic understanding on the fundamentals of pandas and common errors to watch out for.It continues to dig deeper, going from general knowledge to more project specific recipes.  Normally, this would turn me off of a reference book, but these are very common types of projects, making the advanced recipes as useful as the more common ones.  The authors make sure to add how pandas interacts with other common libraries and how to test your pandas code.What I Don't Like:I'm at a loss as to what to write for this section.  The only complaint I could possibly give is that reference books are easier to use as a physical copy, and I have a PDF.  It makes it more difficult to flip back and forth when referring to more than one section.  A little nit picky, I agree.What I Would Like to SeeI would like the author to be ready for when a third edition is needed so that there is a reference still available for us developers.  That's basically it.  I personally plan to buy a physical copy when I can.Overall, I give this book a full 5 out of 5 stars.  The layout was just right, the amount of detail was just right, and the topics covered were just right.  There is honestly nothing I would change with this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pandas 1.x Cookbook: Practical recipes for scientific computing time series analysis and exploratory data analysis using Python 2nd Edition
"This book is great for both beginners and someone already familiar with pandas. And if you are that someone then you know this library is so big that you never quite feel like you know everything.  For instance, how many people use the pandas testing module?  What’s that you say , you didn’t know pandas had a testing module?  Another highlight is the EDA chapter which also includes some nice coverage of Seaborn, in addition to the chapter devoted entirely to visualization libraries.  This will quickly become your goto reference for pandas and working with data.If you are looking for new and interesting ways to leverage pandas and make your work flow more efficient this book will help. It does start at the beginning, but I would be surprised if you didn’t pick up a nugget right in the first chapter.  It says pandas but actually the authors spend a lot of time with NumPy although they don’t always distinguish between the two – which does make sense since pandas is for the most part a wrapper around many libraries, NumPy being chief among them.Personally I would have used fewer pages by showing less output, but that is one of the few complaints I have. I just don’t think we really need to see 10 lines of output for every step.

"I'm college-level math capable.  From the very start, I was confused and perplexed by the author's coherence, which ranged from poetry (yes, poetry) to truncated explanations (see photo of Figure 2.6).  In this example (of height predicting weight) the author carefully explains that the actual weight, y, is distributed randomly according to a normal distribution around the predicted value of y with a standard deviation (p. 27).Then he shows us Figure 2.6, with the posterior predicted weight values superimposed at height values.  Each vertical bar shows a 95% range of the most credible predicted weight values.I could not figure out where he got this 95% range from.  It's not from the standard deviation of the weight values, as far as I could tell.  Exactly where did that sigma come from?It was like this through all of the first part of this book.I am led to conclude that while the author was talking to undergraduates, he did not take into account imprecision in his presentation (which perhaps he could account for in a lecture format?).I wonder if Academic Press will put out a 3rd edition.  If so, I hope they correct the confusing parts.Finally, I really get frustrated by undergraduate math texts that provide no solutions for exercises.

"Edit: I've updated the rating from 1-star to 5 stars to properly reflect the quality of the content. Anything else would be unfair. I returned my original copy which was in an unacceptable condition (see text below plus the comments).  I didn't mind the hazzle much, but I did incur some additional costs. I had to send the original copy back to Amazon which cost more than the 15$ refund, and I also had to pay for the (quick) delivery cost.Nonetheless, my impression is that the book is possibly the best introduction to Bayesian statistics on the market. And not only the best, but also very good in its own right. The book by Gelman et. al. is a leading textbook on the subject, and for a good reason, but the authors assume their readers have mastered intermediary statistics and have received a thorough prior introduction to Bayesian statistics. John Kruschke, in contrast, assumes very little knowledge of the former, and none of the latter.All expositions are intuitive rather than technical. The chapter on R taught me that I still have much to learn on the language, and makes me wonder how inefficient and cumbersome my R code has been thus far.I'm trying to think of any real complaints I have that are not merely a reflection of my eccentric nature, but I keep coming up short.Recommended.-------------Please be aware that my review concerns the quality of the binding of the pages in the book, and not the actual intellectual content. I've only recently begun reading it, and I have no reason to believe that the other positive reviews are anything other than accurate.But yes, good as the exposition of the subject must be, the binding of the pages is poor in regular patterns. Although no pages have fallen out, I can't help but wonder if the book will stay in one piece for very long.I don't know if you can see the picture that I uploaded, but it shows only one opening, on page 82-83.

"This book has its pros and cons.  Short story?  It's a good introduction to application of Bayesian analysis, but in a very long-winded writing style.  I would probably buy it again, but I definitely will not read it again except referring back to the examples.The book is certainly a good introduction to the topic.  The general topic is well motivated and the mathematical framework is laid out in detail using approachable derivations; lots of beta priors and coin tosses, for example (Ch. 2, 4-7, 9).  Some practical problems are addressed as well, such as comparing competing hypotheses and deciding how much data you need to achieve specific goals (Ch. 10, 13)  Once that's done, the generalized linear model is introduced and many different examples are given of how to apply it (Ch. 15-25).  There's a lot of example code in the book and electronically and if you don't care to RTFM there are intro chapters on each of R, JAGS, and Stan (Ch. 2, 8, 14).  There are some interesting discussions comparing frequentist tools like p-values and confidence intervals to the Bayesian approach (Ch. 11-12).  The figures and tables are all well done and informative.  That's all good, and that is what I was looking for: I have a reasonable math and computer background and wanted to spin up from the basics to more advanced stuff quickly and with a practical applied bias.The bad news is, the book is long winded as all get-out.  Some books have junk quotes at the beginning; in this book every chapter has a junk poem and a junk footnote explaining the poem.  Every section seems to begin with a paragraph saying what the last section said and many end with a paragraph ""recapitulating"" the section.  Even the term ""batting average"" gets several sentences of explanation.  The chapters on R, JAGS, and Stan are redundant to their online documentation but I recognize the book needs to be self-contained.  Eleven chapters for the GLM is not so bad, because each chapter changes up the application and the structural particulars; practical issues are introduced in stages along the way like data normalization and structural tradeoffs... but a little extra wordiness over the course of eleven chapters really adds up.  Some math books are dense to the point of skipping steps and make you fight to connect the dots; this book has clarity but proceeds so slowly I had to fight to stay awake (and often lost -- don't read it on the couch).It's fashionable for ""Bayesians"" to dis ""frequentists"" at the moment and this book plays to that crowd but not in an overblown way.  The point should be made however that in many scientific settings research procedures ARE designed up front and expected to be published in detail.  You should understand that p-values and CIs are claiming ""high decision accuracy"" under a process and model, they have their (perhaps limited) place, and in Bayesian model comparison or predictor selection etc. Bayes Factors and unreasonable choices of priors can cause problems of their own.  The book doesn't quite say that there's no panacea, and doesn't discuss the situations in which frequentist  but I hope that is not lost on most readers.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R JAGS and Stan
"This book is outstanding. The author covers Bayesian analysis starting with the assumption that you know virtually nothing about it and builds to the point that you can do actual, meaningful analysis, interpret the results and communicate them to people that are not aware of Bayesian techniques. (I bought the book because of the ""See inside"" feature. Page 5 sealed the deal. If you do any type of statistical analysis check it out.)The writing is clear and there are numerous examples that are typically interesting which really helps. The author has a good sense of humor as well which is rare in a book that covers advanced material like this.The book is long. (>700 pages) But there is a LOT of material being covered. The ""Doing"" part of the book is done with R, JAGS and Stan, so if you aren't familiar with any of those, it's a lot to take in. I wasn't familiar with any of thee and I did fine. I had to read some parts multiple times but that might just be me. I did most of the exercises which really helped. (notable exception: 13.1)The book seems expensive at first. It's a textbook so there's that. However, you also get a very large number of R scripts to demonstrate the concepts. The scripts are useful and in my opinion worth as much as the book. (All of the software is free.) I have already used the scripts to suit analysis I needed to do. The book also really covers multiple topics so once I got into it I realized I got a great deal. I have received more value that I paid.Don't buy this thinking you are going to breeze through it and be able to actually *do* Bayesian analysis well. The book is true to the title but only if you put forth the time and effort. You absolutely can learn an enormous amount from this book.To the author, if you're reading this: Thank you!

"Over the past couple years, I've been trying to learn Bayesian statistics, both for theoretical understanding and for practical use in my job.  That has lead me to read 5-10 different books on the subject (with a range of scopes and focuses), which lead me to read the first edition of this book.  Some of the books that I read are better than others, but I can easily say that Kruschke's was the best introductory book I found.  That is NOT to say that it lacks rigor.  What it does is start off with the basics, and it communicates in a clear, readable, and often humorous approach.  What it does not do is assume that you have an advanced degree in statistics.In addition, the book gives you TONS of useful programming help in R, all in downloadable files.  Even better (for me at least) were the programs that helped access OpenBUGS from R (in the first edition).  That is a tricky process, and I found the book's insight and programs to be very valuable.I would also like to thank the author for reading my mind.  After having worked with OpenBUGS for a little while, I was hearing good things about STAN, and I've been wanting to give it a try.  Right about the time I decided that, this second edition came out, and this time it includes STAN.  Woot!  I'm reading through the second edition, and I'm enjoying it just as much as the first.  Heck, this book is probably worth the price for the programs alone.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R JAGS and Stan
"Beautiful explanations. R code could be more modern, but that issue is addressed by some academics (like professor Randall Pruim with his notes on the book). The concepts are priceless and Dr. Kruschke also makes clear that he has a knack for teaching.The first two parts of the book are dedicated to explaining the underlying ideas that build Bayesian analysis. Part III goes through applied aspects and crucial aspects of model interpretation.12/10, would buy again",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R JAGS and Stan
"I have an undergraduate degree in Statistics however I never learned Bayesian statistics as this is typically taught to graduate students. Even so, this book is very easy to learn from. The author puts together a recommended order of reading the chapters depending on how much time you have. I read 3-4 chapters and I skipped ahead to the model with one predictor (essentially the linear regression model with one predictor). He gives the code for programs with comments in R that are easy to understand and run.His website has all the programs written in R that use JAGS and Stan and solutions to the exercises to the first 15 or so chapters (more are on the way).Loving this book, style of reading is also very conversational.

"If you want to start learning R, there several things you may want to consider. There are two kind of skills you want to cultivate: programming skills and actual data analysis ones. In principle, you can learn techniques alone, but then your creativity as a data analyst will be limited and probably you will end up writing poor code. Alternatively focusing only on coding may make you a good programmer, but it will be hard to get started on putting your skill into practice. Any book should strike a tradeoff in where to stand between training you in these two topics. Cotton's book try its best in this and does a pretty good job. The first part of the book, covering the intricacies of the language is the one I found most useful. I has all sort of good advise and explanations on the data structures and functions you can use. It is appropriately applied - not just about computation and programming, but actually links how they are applied in the actual data analysis. In this sense, this was the most original and interesting part of the book.  The second part of the book, covering data analysis techniques was more conventional but still  good. As such, there are perhaps better books if you are interested on any of the two sides (""machine learning for hackers"" is very good to learn how to apply the techniques and seeing them in action; ""Introduction to statistical learning"" is a bit more theoretical; Advanced R or The Art of R Computing are unbeatable about teaching the language, although a bit dray).The approach of Cotton is really instructive. He is friendly, he write well in a easygoing fashion and the book is full of useful tips that helped me to understand how the language merge with the technique.The book is not encyclopedic, it does not cover every single topic (there are better books for that, Matloff and Wickhams books are better). Instead, it does a really good job as a tutorial that walks you through many topics that are somehow not covered in many other books -the chapter that covers factors and dates is perhaps not something you will deal with everyday, but very useful if you have to.Overall, I think the book teaches you really well how to play with the R language.A very final remark. I've seen other comments that suggest this is an introductory book. The book hardly takes things from scratch. If you have never written a line of code, you are likely to find it, particularly the first part, pretty dry. It is more an intermediate text, otherwise you will find yourself wondering why you need to know all these pages about data structures if you just want to learn to load a csv file and run a regression.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learning R: A Step--Step Function Guide to Data Analysis

This book is so well written and clear I am amazed. If you need to review some basic statistics in order to perform more advanced procedures in research, this is the book for you. Thank you Dr. Hatcher for his book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Advanced Statistics in Research: Reading Understanding and Writing Up Data Analysis Results
"I rarely post reviews on Amazon, but Dr. Hatcher's book compelled me to do so.  I've never been a math guy, despite being an engineer.  I can solve equations with the best of them, but often struggle with a pragmatic understanding of the material.  Even after several statistics classes, and a few peer-reviewed articles to my name, I had a hard time giving a simple, intuitive explanation of why certain statistical procedures are used over others.Dr. Hatcher's book was instrumental in fixing this for me.  It's full of wonderful explanations in basic English, and articulates concepts with descriptions, then enhances those descriptions with equations.  Many authors expect equations to speak for themselves, which is great for mathematicians, and not so great for the rest of us.  Dr. Hatcher's book is statistics for the rest of it.  Highly recommended.In addition to this book, I also recommend ""The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis"" by Raj Jain.  And I would opine that Dr. Hatcher's book needs a Kindle version.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Advanced Statistics in Research: Reading Understanding and Writing Up Data Analysis Results
Best statistics book I've ever had. I have it at work with me as a reference and read it at home to constantly refresh my memory of some basic concepts as well. I cannot agree more with the other comments - the author explains difficult stats concepts very well and in an easy-to-understand way. I have statistics books with all the crazy equations too but I always come back to this book because for me understanding the concepts is much more important than being able to calculate the numbers which I can easily do with software anyway.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Advanced Statistics in Research: Reading Understanding and Writing Up Data Analysis Results

I had expected more from a book at this price.

"This book has a rigorous assortment of workbook questions normally associated with Deitel books that help you master the Python syntax and its many libraries and also help to build the kind of critical thinking skills needed when you are tackling a programming project. The introduction to various advanced topics like machine learning and data science is refreshing, but each of those areas warrants reading whole other books, so this is better used as a survey. My major complaint has to do specifically with the kindle version of the book. It is pretty atrocious. I’m not sure if this is Deitel’s fault or Amazon’s, but the ebook was obviously rushed to production. Frequent problems include words that are jumbled together without spaces, tables that have lost their formatting or are missing entirely, graphics not in the logical place, missing operators (minus sign is one that’s often missing), and a general lack of page formatting.

"(As a disclaimer, I have an advanced degree in signal processing and image analysis.) This appears to be a textbook for an advanced course in finance. I had hoped it was a book for investors who have an interest in programming and writing their own portfolio management software in R. Instead, it focuses on being a book that covers many of the advanced time series analysis methods used in financial modeling. That would be fine if the author had presented more examples of how the methods were applied to financial modeling and how the results were used. It would have been helpful to also have more comparisons of the pros and cons of the different methods.What I found lacking in this book was more description of the application of the methods described. The presentation is: here is a method for analyzing a time series and here is some R code (sometimes). It assumes that the reader already understands the derivation/origin of the method being presented from a signal processing/mathematics standpoint. The text does a poor job of explaining the role of each method in financial modeling. How would one apply a given technique and exactly for what purpose? So, the book seems to be written for that narrow audience who knows the derivation of the methods presented and knows the application as well. Equations are presented with a terse explanation of their parameters.Finally, the book cries out for a good editor. Dr. Tsay does not write clearly, unfortunately, and in many instances the syntax of the book is cumbersome, making the meaning difficult to discern.",3.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Analysis of Financial Data with R

"As the Russians say, ""the veteran horse plows a straight but shallow furrow"". The book's preface acknowledges an overlap with the earlier ""Analysis of financial time series"" (AFTS), pointing out the novelty of included examples. I would call ""overlap"" an understatement, and describe ""Introduction to analysis of financial data with R"" (IAFD) as a subset of AFTS, illustrated with examples, implemented in R. I may have wished for something fancier than the oh-so-nineties repertoire of ARIMA and GARCH - the marginal exceptions show up in the sections on ACD and EVT - but accept that the book is meant to be a textbook in a master's-level course. (Yet is priced at over $100! This made the choice between four and three stars easy). I am unimpressed with its usage of R: the ARMA/GARCH analyses are quite repetitive, the plotting is basic, data manipulation altogether absent, an early encouraging use of quantmod package does not develop at all. (If you visit the book's web page - and you will have to, to get the scripts that, for example,  estimate GARCH flavors; in the book, it's just ""source(..)"" - you will count nine R packages used: fGarch, MASS, evir, quantreg, quantmod, TSA, fracdiff, fBasics, mnormt). The occasional typos - the amusing ""Merry Lynch"" has been caught in the errata, but others remain - add to the impression of a path-of-low-resistance approach. Even so, given the author's caliber, you get a useful, quality book. I would suggest taking a look at IAFD and the two books by David Ruppert, to see which one(s) you prefer.",3.0 out of 5 stars,An Introduction to Analysis of Financial Data with R

"In 1980, Michael Lewis-Beck published Applied Regression: An Introduction, a remarkably succinct, informative, and above all accessible introduction to regression analysis.  I used it selectively as ancillary reading in courses I taught in basic statistics, quantitative research methods, and multiple regression. Students loved it.  Finally, a statistics text they could use to help them with material they didn't understand in class or that was not clearly explained in their other readings!Unbeknownst to me, the same author later published another Sage paperback titled Data Analysis:  An Introduction.  I became aware of this 1995 text only recently, and, after reading it, I realized that the last fifteen of the twenty-three years I taught basic statisitcs before retiring in 2010 would have been much easier for me and much more useful for beginning students if I had learned of the book when it first appeared.As with Lewis-Beck's Applied Regression text, Data Analysis is a tribute to the author's ability to write both succinctly and accessibly about counter-intuitive material that students commonly dread.  No reason for dread here, however, because once again Lewis-Beck has written a text that is really useful for beginners who want to use it as supplementary reading for a course or -- wonder of wonders! -- a self-teaching tool.  I had long been convinced that the latter objective, producing a reasonably thorough introduction to basic statistics that would serve the interests of those who wanted to teach themselves but who lacked a good deal of mathematical aptitude, was something that would never be written.  Lewis-Beck, however, proved me wrong, and he did it in less than eighty pages.If his text has limitations they are manifest in its peculiarly sociologically orientation, meaning that an obligatory introduction to elementary probability theory is not included, and one-way analysis of variance, a tool that is used and misused much too often in some behavioral science disciplines, is not introduced.However, there is much more thorough coverage of regression analysis than is included in all but a few introductory texts.  Also, simpler techniques, such as the ubiquitous t test and non-parametric measures of association, including those based on Chi-square, are given their due.  Lewis-Beck, however, realizes statistics starts to get interesting when analysts begin applying multiple regression.  By the time the reader has worked through the first forty pages of Data Analysis, he or she is ready to make a first foray into material that most instructors save for a second course.  If Lewis-Beck's earlier book, Applied Regression, were read as a sequel to Data Analysis, a student could honestly and confidently claim to be pretty well on the way to being a reasonably capable social science statistician.Textbook publishing is a notorious racket.  But Lewis-Beck's inexpensive and masterfully written Data Analysis: An Introduction provides a welcome reprieve from the usual rip-off routine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis: An Introduction (Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences)

"I received the book as a gift. This book was incredibly frustrating for a dummies book. The authors throw code at you and do not explain every line ! How can one expect to be able to program by one's self if code is not explained to you when you are learning it.  I understand that the book assumes you have some knowledge of python, however even if you have knowledge of some python, you may not have knowledge of the commands used in data science. If you are NEW TO DATA SCIENCE, IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL IF EVERY LINE OF CODE WAS EXPLAINED TO YOU (or every long line). And if you are new to python you will be almost completely lost in many sections of this book. I have read quite a few Dummies books on programming, computer science, and math, and this is the first book I have read in the Dummies series that presupposes you are advanced in PYTHON but also advanced in DATA SCIENCE. The reason people buy dummies books is because they need to learn the subject INITIALLY. Why can't every line of code be explained??? Especially when the lines are long and complex. I have read R Projects For Dummies (For Dummies by Joseph Schmuller AND IT IS BEAUTIFUL ! THANK GOD FOR THIS AUTHOR. HE EXPLAINS EVERY LINE OF CODE AND WRITES LIKE HE WANTS TO TEACH YOU A SUBJECT THAT YOU ARE NEW OR RELATIVELY NEW IN.

"The author covers all the basis in the book but the issue is that the book is a bit convoluted. From a code standpoint the author has a habit of defining function inputs as global variables which is really confusing, ie:B = 10...20 lines of code and 10 pages later...def func(b):  return b + BWhich is poor habit for writing code, and also quite confusing to read. The other part where the book becomes convoluted is its layout. Essentially each chapter breaks down into a number of sections each covering one mathematical operation or idea. So Variance for instance, you get a quick textbook definition of the term, a mathematical proof then the python code. It would have been nice if the author explained the ideas a bit better with non-proofy terminology, in that same vein it would have been nice if the author could have explained the math in his own words so that the reader could understand the intent of the mathematical operations, and not just some quick algebra. If you have a bunch of proofy definitions of the greeks its hard to look at that and feel like you have a holistic and thorough understanding of the ideas behind them and why it is you're using them.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Financial Theory with Python: A Gentle Introduction
"I really liked this book. The author did a really good job. It's a mixture of Python and statistics so some previous background in both will allowing you to benefit entirely from reading this book. Especially prior experience with Python will help you understand the code used by the author, as it is not a simple one. He often uses wrapper functions and class inheritance, so if this doesn't ring a bell, I suggest learning a bit of Python first. Otherwise you can skip the programming parts, but I think you will lose a large part of the book's value.Statistics here is more basic than Python code, for sure. But it does serve well as a introduction to statistical analysis. A software developer wanting to start learning statistics is probably a good candidate for this book. But not the other way around. After reading it I think I still prefer to use R to generate probability density plot, than Python.Anyway, it is almost a must read for anyone on their patch to data scientist career. It not long or super expensive, so if you are interested in stats and Python, just read it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Think Stats: Exploratory Data Analysis
"The book generally explains the concepts well, but could provide more details and more examples.  I found the code actually very hard to understand, because the function and variable names are often missing clarity.  If the code were improved, it would facilitate the reader's learning greatly.That being said, for the price on Kindle, I found the content and format extremely useful to start getting practical experience via the exercises.  Since this is based on a very friendly and popular tool, Jupyter, it is a great introduction to that application.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Think Stats: Exploratory Data Analysis
"This book is a great introduction to statistics for any person with basic programming skills. The main issue, when you tackle any math-heavy stuff - is that you are bombarded with a huge amount of formulas, but can't ""feel"" the practical side of the subject.In this book, you have a simple way to practically and swiftly try each new concept through Jupyter Notebook interactive examples. Transform the data, draw a chart - observe results. The fastest feedback loop you can get learning any math stuff.If you want to get the best results from the book, spend some time and setup Jupyter Notebook, or just run them directly in Google Collab service.

"It pains me to think that trees died so this book could be printed.  The author has two primary topic elements (Python and statistics) and he misses on them both.  The discussion of statistics is insufficiently supported from a mathematical perspective and the Python is little more than a shameless plug for the author's own package.  Worse still, as other reviewers have pointed out, many of the functions in his package are pointless replications of already existing statistical functions.  Moreover, the wording of his text seems almost intentionally obfuscated to avoid telling readers there are pre-existing functions in common packages such as NumPy and matplotlib which make his function irrelevant. I purchased this book as it was required for a class, but I won't even resell it used because I am morally opposed to selling anything I already know to be so completely defective there is no way it can be of any use to the buyer.

This also makes me believe, the authors and publishers think this book is mediocre at best. If they thought the book were good, they surely would have prepared solutions for some exercises for people who use this book, e.g., for self-study purposes, as a refresher etc.(Don't get me wrong though: this actually is a well written book.

For instance, in the chapters on quantitative anaylsis, there is no mention of confidence intervals or margins of error, which are pretty basic statistics work. Consequently, the book will not turn you into a data analyst. What it will do is give you a strong overview of the discipline to springboard into more detailed learning.

"According to Dr. Hal R.Varian, Google’s Chief Economist, ""The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades."" This 2009 quote talks about a skill known as data storytelling.Dr. Winston's ""Analytics Stories"" does a fantastic job at introducing the reader to data storytelling. He builds over 50 business cases that range from politics to baseball. Dr. Winston uses mostly MS Excel to make sense of data, process it, visualize it and communicate it in a compelling way.For example, chapter 52 applies the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model and extends the application to include demand uncertainty and reorder point. It also illustrates ""the power of two"" rule on inventory management. It sounds quite specialized, and it is, but it is written in a way that is fun to read and very visual. I teach logistics and supply chain management at college level and will use this chapter to teach the EOQ model to my students.On a completely different application, chapter 46 discusses whether roundabouts are a good idea or not.

It reminds me the most of Korner's ""The Pleasure of Counting"" in that each chapter presents a different case/problem/story and outlines the insights and the math used to untangle it.

Metrics and jargon and clearly explained.It is extremely well documented as well: all sources for articles, texts, data, studies, etc. are cited in-paragraph for the reader's benefit. This alone increased my reading list considerably.The best part of the book is that for most of the chapters, Professor Winston presents a quantitative/statistical analysis of the story using Excel worksheets, which should make it accessible to the non-programming crowd.

In short, the application of Benford’s law is lacking, saying the least. With 214 samples, we can only be 43.3% confident (my calculation) that Madoff cheated. In general, that’s not a high enough confidence level. In general, we aim for 90% or 95%. In summary, the reader gets a basic idea of applying Benford’s law, but that’s it.Don’t get me wrong; it’s an exciting book that tackles many analytics problems.

"There are textbooks on time series which focus on the theoretical part and then there are cookbooks that promise readymade recipes. This book strikes a fine balance between theory and its practical application with real-world case studies and how KNIME can be used as a visual programming (low-code/no-code) tool to solve it. The KNIME workflows and sample datasets help the reader better understand the concepts and their applications. By following the learning-by-doing style the book takes the reader along each and every step of the time series forecasting in its real-world application.The first part covers the theoretical foundations of time series along with an introduction to the KNIME analytics platform. The second part covers six predictive modeling use cases starting from basic statistical techniques to machine learning based forecasting. The last section (three dedicated chapters) covers advanced topics like implementing forecasting solutions on scalable distributed platforms (Spark, Keras, H2O). However, it requires a CUDA-enabled GPU.To summarize, if you learn best by doing, you can't go wrong with this book. You'll want to check out the book's companion workflows at KNIME Hub.

Very little background with time series analysis or higher mathematics is assumed. However, that experience certainly wouldn't hurt, as some topics can be challenging—Fourier transforms and neural networks, to name just two.One of my favorite aspects of the book is that it clearly describes how to perform these analytic techniques within KNIME. The exact nodes and configurations are shown, and explanations are given on why nodes are configured the way they are. The reader is not left wondering, ""why did they do this step?"" Ignoring the topic of time series analysis, the reader of this book will, at the very least, come away with a better understanding of KNIME Analytics Platform and its many available nodes.In my day job, I work with clients who use KNIME.

"This book provides an excellent step-by-step introduction to statistics and Stata. It covers the basics of the research process, data collection, sampling, questionnaire design, and writing research (with a good overview of how to do research projects). There is a separate chapter on writing research papers, which rare in this kind of book. Notably, it also includes APA guidance.This book could be covered two semester stats course. Ideally, it would be used in an intermediate-advanced undergraduate course or a lower level graduate class. It addresses both methods and stats.

"This book is a fantastic resource for those in the field who are interested in causation and robust data analysis. Speaking as a Sr. Data Scientist, I found nearly every page of this book both approachable and relevant. I've recommended it to virtually everyone on my team and in some sense I think it should be required reading for the role.Regarding the delivery of the content, Buisson strikes a healthy balance between rigor and accessibility that I think will cater to a large audience in the field. There is some math but it's not a textbook and the intuition is always clear. Regarding the content itself I almost cannot speak highly enough. In terms of causal inference, many books cover DAGs, chains, colliders, the backdoor criterion etc. but few provide a sensible framework for how to actually go about constructing these DAGs in a given context. Buisson does just this and the end result feels highly tractable (in lieu of some gigantic DAG where there is a cause to everything). Other chapters that I found highly relevant covered bootstrapping, all things experiments, moderation (interaction) and mediation (instrumental variables). All of which I have already found helpful in my actual day to day as data scientist.There are many topics this book does not cover, so do not go in thinking this is a one stop shop. But perhaps the best feature of this book is the content that Buisson does cover that appears absent in so many others. Buisson is an applied scientist and this experience shines through brightly. If you are in the field and you're not just building black box models (cool if you are but you'll know if this is not you) then you might just love this book.Books to pair this with: Anything by Angrist and Pischke.

"Over the years I've bought many Bayesian Analysis textbooks, the reason being I knew from ML academics that working with distributions is the ""true"" way of doing ML instead of just point estimates like in industrial ML.Before picking up this book I had given up on ever finding a real use-case for Bayesian ML because most of the other often recommended textbooks I owned were happy with long tedious mathematical derivations that wouldn't even bother explaining why a technique is important or how to implement it.This book is exceptional in that it gives you the historical context behind how certain techniques were evolved and an excellent intuition for how they work. The book also comes with an R Bayesian Analysis library which also has excellent ports in Julia and Python on Github. In the case where you don't have gigantic amounts of data and where you'd like to question assumptions that you have about data, this book will teach you a way of how to think about data that is sorely lacking in any sort of Deep Learning text.All of the algorithms in this book have stood the test of time and will continue to be relevant for the foreseeable future, thankfully this book exists to make these algorithms understandable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and STAN (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)

"I have used many Excel how-to manuals over the years, and I can say unequivocally that this is the most high-end product available for Excel business modeling. The content in this book is the type of material that you would learn in an Ivy League MBA program (~$100k in tuition) or at a top consulting firm after years experience -- all for the price of a textbook. The pedigree of the author is incredible, both academically and industry-wise, and I truly felt as if I was learning from the preeminent guy in the field. I think the biggest advantage of this book over similar products is that the author uses real-life examples that he has encountered in his decades of consulting experience in industry to teach the reader complex modeling from finance to supply chain to sports analytics. Unlike other material I have used, the author is adept at engaging the reader and making you feel like he is talking directly to you. I am a consultant at one of the most notable firms in the world, and this book has become the secret weapon that differentiates me from my peers.Pros:1. The examples are laid out very well and the author provides files that you can download to follow along with;2. The author does not use boring examples like comparable products, yet real-life problems that the reader can relate to;3. The author has a tremendous pedigree and can be considered an expert in his field;4. The material in this book has made me the premier Excel guy at my organization that everyone comes to in order to solve problems.Cons:1.

"The content is great, you're going to learn a lot from this book. The book is huge which isn't a problem, but something you should note if you're deciding between the print and kindle versions. My main issues are with the format of the book and example problems.First, I find it strange that they don't include a short chapter at the beginning about shortcuts. They probably did this because they didn't want to include both Windows and Mac shortcuts.My recommendation to the author: Include a tear-out shortcut page in the beginning of the book for readers to reference.Second, the example workbooks are inconsistent. All examples include a workbook with the solutions filled in, but only some examples offer a blank workbook for you to fill in yourself. In the cases where there is only the solved workbook available, it is easy enough to clear the cells yourself, but it spoils the fun a bit.However, the main issue is that every example is in a separate workbook. Including a separate workbook for both the solutions and the blank workbooks. When you have 6+ examples per chapter, you have to open a minimum of 11 workbooks per chapter for 89 chapters which seems excessive. If you have the ""Enable Editing"" prompt enabled within Office, you will have to enable editing on each workbook individually which can be a pain.My recommendation to the author: 1 workbook per chapter. Include separate sheets for each example and solution.My recommendation to readers: Disable the ""Enable Editing"" promptFinally, there are some sloppy errors in the wording of some of the examples. For example, in one of the chapters they are talking about doing a 10 year forecast, but halfway through the example they switch from years to months. It's not that big of a deal, but it's this inattention to detail that makes you question the author's credibility.My recommendation to John Pierce: As the editor, you should probably be more attentive if the author is going to name-drop you in the acknowledgments.Even with these problems, I still have no problem recommending this book.

"If I were shipwrecked and had only one statistics book with me,* this would be the one.Why?1. For most applied uses of multi-level (mixed effects) regression in the social sciences, this book is appropriately comprehensive.  You will want for little.2. The book is R oriented. Though R might not be sufficient for all your needs, it is necessary. R has become the coordination point.3. The book deals with basic concepts in probability, simulation, inference, and causation. The focus is on understanding what you are doing, not simply applying standard recipes. That's important because you can't competently apply the tools you will learn from this book without understanding these basic concepts. There are no shortcuts.4. Nevertheless, the book contains a bunch of recipes, which I found helpful,  for example, when learning how to simulate in R. Also, the authors write using a compact coding style. I'm grateful to have learned some simplifying tricks.5. The authors focus on graphical tests and visualizing data. That's how you ought to be exploring data and testing/interpreting your results.6. The book is oriented to generalized linear mixed effects (multi-level) modelling. When you learned ordinary regression you learned a special case. If you haven't learned ordinary regression, start with GLMMs.7. The book is oriented to Bayesian statistics. Whether you use Bayesian statistics is up to you, however you owe it to yourself not to make embarrassing objections. Gelman and Hill do a fine job of explaining the motivations.Downsides1. The individual sentences of this book are clear, however I felt that some sections could have had fuller explanations. Perhaps I'm a slow learner, but I had to move even slower than usual in some places, not because there was a thicket of mathematical detail (there's refreshingly little extraneous maths) but because the explanations were brief.  For example, the sections on simulating data took me a couple of reads.2.  Software development is moving fast, and this book is already a little stale. That said, it is far from outdated. All the tools still work, and *most* are the same you'd be using now.  That said some very good new statistical and graphical packages are available now (such as  MCMCglmm, ggplot2, Rstan, blme,  and others) and many will want to be running and interpreting their models using these. Note Gelman is involved in developing the latter two, and a bunch of others.  No matter.  This book is all most applied researchers will ever need, and again, you need to know the conceptual underpinnings.  The tools will always be changing.*.. and with me: my compute, power, the motivation to work, abundant coffee, a fine cafe to work in... & etc.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models
"Pros:They tackle a complex topic from many different angles. They present enough code and theory to get people up and running with the techniques, assuming some prior familiarity with likelihood based inference and R. Otherwise you might need to dig through some of the references to understand everything. Regardless, this book is a valuable reference to keep in your library.They use matrix notation sparingly and this helps the reader focus on the important concepts of multilevel modeling. I am not even remotely a statistician so my attention would have been lost if I had to sort through a bunch of matrix transpositions and inversions in addition to all of the multilevel notation.The authors provide many useful references that help reinforce difficult ideas/concepts and that elaborate on topics that are not explored in depth.I had no prior experience using WinBUGS and the authors provided enough information for me to successfully execute some models that integrate R and WinBUGS. That is no small feat and the authors should be commended because somehow I understood what was going on.Cons:The organization of the book seems scattered and could be a little more consistent. On pp 245-246, the authors go on a diatribe about ""fixed"" and ""random"" effects terminology, claim that much of the literature that applies these terms does so inconsistently, disown these terms by saying they will avoid using them entirely, and then continue using these terms throughout the book.The website needs some work. You need to already know how to use R to open different types of files (and maybe some basics of variable assignment)in order to reproduce all of their examples. This book will not hold your hand through the steps like many R books.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models
"Overall, I really like this book. I think there are certainly flaws, but the vast majority is quite useful. I'm not a statistician, but have taken a couple of classes in statistics, through multivariate linear models and some logistic regression. This book was definitely at my level, and didn't require a background in mathematical statistics. I found the parts where the authors went through building linear and logistic models and interpreting the results to be very informative, even after taking a few classes.The book covers a lot of material, and so nothing is delved into very deeply. There is more than one section you will need to look elsewhere in order to supplement the one or two sentences dedicated to a topic.You should be experienced with using R in order to get much out of the examples. For example, they use the arm library a lot, but never show in the code samples to load the library. If you've never used R (I have) then you might be lost. The most frustrating thing I'm finding is the data that accompanies the book. It is not documented and not formed to match the examples in the book. For example, the height and earnings data uses 1 and 2 classifications for sex, but I couldn't find it documented which one was for male and female. I little trial and error and I eventually figured it out. Little things like that don't make it easy to work with. The data comes in numerous formats too  (Stata, DAT, asc) instead of a generic csv file.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models
"High quality text from the well respected Gelman and Hall. Topics range from probability, linear models, logit model, generalized linear models (eg. Poisson), multilevel linear, multilevel generalized linear, causal inference, and Bayesian.Each chapter covers these topics with a description of a social problem that the duo have encountered and analyzed. The dataset is described with enough detail for me to data wrangle my own data into a similar form. The assumptions to statistical equations are explicitly described and shown in their development in statistical equations. The third development is the R programming syntax that helps me apply their syntax to my own analysis. This section lacks descriptions of broader function options because it is an inappropriate place to talk about them. Other resources such as UCLA's statistical website, PennState statistical website, RBloggers, RDocumentation, etc will help in that regard. Lastly comes the analysis of the output. Both the correct graphical output and flawed ways of thinking about the problem are presented in order to demonstrate ""What To Do"" and ""What Not To Do"".I have not had a chance to use this as a learning text. Thus, I cannot comment on how well it teaches the concepts. It's been my go-to reference for programming a multilevel poisson model.Gelman and Hill do have section devoted to Causal Inference and Bayesian analysis.

"I'm a social sciences PhD student and this is the book I keep going back to.  There are a huge number of texts that you will find useful, but this one stands out for being particularly useful from cover to cover.  A few of the advantages:- theoretically rigorous, but done by example and counter-example vs. mathematical proofs- tremendous number of examples with code and interpretation- didactic approach yet organized for quick reference- oriented toward practice vs. theorySome other things I like that others might not:  Gelman is not a big fan of NHST inference and so he does not emphasize it.  Nor does he stress jargony interpretation of tables of regression coefficients.  Rather he emphasizes interpretation by simulation and counterfactuals.  In that way he lays the groundwork for Bayesian analysis.Gelman is one of the developers of the R package lmer which estimates multilevel models.  As such, it is the best reference for doing multilevel models in R.  But realize that it is so much more.  They spend the first half of the book reviewing single-level (?) regression and so the transition to multilevel is intuitive.  You will understand it as an extension of what you already know.  And (I keep saying this) you will find yourself going back to reference their coverage of regression when you have a question.The book is brilliant.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models
"The good: If you want to delve into the theory behind multilevel and hierarchical models, this is a solid book, and less dense than other statistics book. I found the examples interesting, even though it was outside of my subject area.HOWEVER, as others have noted, this book is not a useful guide for programming these models in R (though it attempts to be). Following along the examples in R would be incredibly illustrative, if the code worked, but unfortunately the programming examples appear to not have been proofread or de-bugged. The book is rife with errors to this extent. Many of the sample datasets require data clean up--the authors don't even post the final datasets online! Workable example code is nowhere to be found. The examples at the end of each chapter are nice too, but no solutions anywhere! Thus, I find following along to this book really frustrating. I had considered using this in teaching, but there is not nearly enough support to do so--as it is, I find it a solid book for someone with a good grasp of statistics, and will only be useful when used in concert with supplementary reading (e.g. Statistical Rethinking by McElreath)In short, it is really hard to grasp the concepts without running the examples in R, but the book does not provide accurate code or data to do so.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models

I'm almost certain I scored my current job, which I love, because of the skills I learned from this book.Since the first reading, I've been proselytizing this book to all my colleagues and our interns. Consequently, most now own it and use it frequently. Because I've loaned it out so much, I bought a second copy.Why do I like it? Simply, I am a quantitatively capable person without much patience. I can't sit down for hours with Greene and feel like I've learned much. I need examples, good writing, arguments, and lots of practice data/code. This book has those things.Who is this book not for? I'd not recommend it to people who get a lot out of mathematical statistics, engineers, and the like.

The examples as written in the books don't always work on my machine, the examples as downloaded from their website don 't always work on my machine.  I think I'm spending 3/4 of my time working through these ""minor"" issues and about 1/4 actually understanding the concepts the book is written about.

This is not a cut-and-paste text for programmers - it gives the basic theory and algorithms for each technique. Still, the presentation is quite readable and fairly easy to put into practice.The book's emphasis is on imputation - filling in values so that analysis can move forward. This is something to approach with real caution, though. The imputed (synthesized) values must not perturb the analysis, so the imputation must differ according to the analysis being performed. The authors present a variety of imputation techniques, as well as bootstrap, jacknife, and other techniques for measuring the quality of the results.The authors also dedicate chapters to approaches that work only with available data, and to cases where missing data can not simply be ignored.This is the most thorough and practical guide I know to handling missing data.

"I have previously given great praise to this book under the pen name of statman13.  To add to my previous reviews I should say that Little and Rubin continue to be the top researchers in this field and Don Rubin often consults with the FDA, the pharmaceutical industry and statistical review boards.  He is an eloquent speaker and writer as is also his co-author Rod Little.  The development of the model classifications  MAR, MCAR and MNAR (or nonignorable missingness)is due to Rubin and is quite common these days in the thinking of researchers involved with missing data in their analyses.  In the cases where the missing mechanism is not ignorable pattern mixture models, that Little had a major role in developing, are given. All this wonderful work is spelled out in this book.  This second edition has added much discussion of Bayesian methods using the current computational advantages of Gibbs sampling.  Also some specific techniques have software implementation in SAS or SPlus and this is pointe dout by the authors when it comes up.  I think that rather than searching through the index to find where sofware is mentioned it would be nice to have a section of the book devoted to it.  oddly the software tool SOLAS that Rubin had a part in aiding the development does not appear to be mentioned in the book.  Perhaps the authors will expand upon the discussion of software in the next edition.  Also new to this edition is more detailed coverage of multiple imputation.  Resampling techniques are also discussed in the context of getting sensible estimates of the standard deviation of the estimated parameters in the face of imputing some of the data.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Analysis with Missing Data (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)

"This review is for the 2nd Edition of the book. ggplot2 has changed a lot in recent years and the old book is no longer useful.Hadley has rewritten the book on ggplot2 completely and utilized the examples and questions from the communities on StackOverflow and GoogleGroups as a guide. The book starts off gentle, but does assume you have basic knowledge of R (installation of packages, some base functions, loading libraries and simple syntax). The components of the grammar are brought in piecewise and in a logical way that should help early learners and refresh those of us who have used the package for a while. There are tons of code examples which are colored coded for legibility and syntax reasons. Each block of code is followed by the output from that code, which helps the user understand what is expected. At the end of major sections, there are exercises which not only help you understand what you've learned, but also get you thinking about how you would analyze a similar dataset. This is really important because if you do these exercises, you will be well prepared to implement the visualization strategies herein on any dataset.Chapters 9-11 introduce auxiliary packages in the tidyverse (formerly ""Hadleyverse"") including dplyr, tidyr, and broom, which are used to discuss an entire data analysis pipeline. This sections does a good job of introducing these tools and what you would use them for. If you're interested in digging further into these packages, Hadley has been writing another book called R for Data Science which will hopefully be on sale in late 2016. An early version can be found here: [...]The last chapter is about programming with ggplot2. Hadley introduces some very useful, more advanced methods for plotting with ggplot2 from creating your own functions to using standard evaluation. A very useful introduction for more advanced users.Overall, the book is a gentle and thorough introduction to the ggplot2 package for beginners and a very useful references to all of the updates introduced in the last few years since the last ggplot book (Winston Chang's R Graphics Cookbook)

"I've been working with this book for a couple of months now -- lots of tabs and highlights.  It is amazingly comprehensive for it's length but if you are pretty new to ggplot, this is a challenging introduction in the following way:  the examples start at a pretty complex level of aesthetic combos and they are a bit too clever.  As an example, things like the geom 'label' uses a dataframe named 'label' to place a label of 'label' on a plot -- cute but not helpful to the reader.  This happens too much for beginners.  It's like someone who is excellent in algebra naming all the different variables in an equation ""x"" -- they can keep track easily in their head  because they breathe algebra and it saves them the trouble of thinking up a bunch of different variable names that they don't need for clarity.  But it makes it hard going for a newbie trying to learn the pieces.  In this way and others,  many portions of the book are like a second-level of ggplot use;  it's easier to learn the basics on one of the websites or one of the other cookbooks, then come here for clever ways to combine lots of things into a couple of lines of code.  Sometimes Wickham gives the impression of wanting to teach the material but can't avoid opportunities to show some cleverness -- that's great for experienced people looking for tricks but it makes this book initially a bit frustrating at points for some users (like me).  I still use it a lot but it's not a great reference for real basics.  This is in part because the indexed refs to geoms are to an initial intro of the term but if you want to see how to use that geom beyond the single initial use, you need to read the whole book because the specifics are embedded in many other examples.  This is no doubt on purpose but, again, be aware it's not a very good reference-type book.",3.0 out of 5 stars,ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (Use R)

"This book 2016 version of the 2009 book and is really good. Great examples! Updated to the current version of R so all the examples and references are to functions and packages in the current R version that I am using today... which makes it much easier to follow.Writing style is very clear. Examples of each concept along with review questions that really make you think about what has just been covered rather  than just regurgitating facts.Overall style is concept, some details, and examples.Sometimes I wish Hadley would use more of an primitive breakdown approach to examples. For example one example starts with using loess to build some data for an example. I'd rather just see some plain data rather than a building some data from line fitting. That would make it easer to see how data flows through an example. I appreciate that what Hadley ends up with is real world data, but I, and this may just be me, I like things explained at a more primitive level.But in any case this book is not just showing you some neat plots, even though it has many, it is giving you the fundamentals you need to be able to implement from scratch the plots you think up in your head to point out statistical features in your data.",5.0 out of 5 stars,ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (Use R)
"I found chapter 2 guiding you through the basics very good.  The remainder of the book is often challenging and cryptic.  Numerous of the codes did not work.  That was especially true for a key chapter (11 Modeling for visualization) where some codes early in the chapter did not work, and prevented me from getting any benefit from the majority of the chapter.  That was true of the codes that the author posted on the Internet too.  Also, even though the graphs are often impressive they invariably do not convey accurate confidence intervals.  Using ggplot2, specifying Confidence Intervals @95% level, you are lucky if you capture 40% of the actual observations (instead of ~ 95%).My experience in developing my R skills is perplexing.  I have learned how to model some of the most challenging models at the cutting edge of Machine Learning.  And, books on the subjects are invariably really clear and helpful.  The coding is surprisingly easy.  And, the overall experience most rewarding.However, when dealing with R graphs my experience has been radically different.  I have spent a ridiculous amount of money on expensive R graph books (including this one), and time.  And, so far I have not gotten much out of it.  I have run a lot more often into codes that did not work.  And, too often the coding for even a basic graph can often be a lot more complex and fragile than for an advanced Machine Learning model that does an amazing amount of complex calculations in no time.  Granted R graphs also do have very powerful underlying quantitative algorithms.  Yet, I find the wide discrepancy in my learning experience between the two very perplexing (graphs vs. models).",2.0 out of 5 stars,ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (Use R)

"I used this book for a class in survival analysis (a graduate level biostats course) and I found it very useful. Much of the first several chapters are fairly quick relative to many graduate statistics texts and focuses on application with less emphasis on theory. Overall, I have no major qualms with the book. The author goes on a bit longer than necessary but I'd rather end up skimming text than be stuck deciphering terse material. This extra explanation also opens the book up to a wider audience.A solid understanding of basic statistics is necessary to get started in this book. To get more, 4+ semester-long statistics courses, at least one based in regression, would be ideal. A basic knowledge in mathematical analysis as it pertains to statistics (mainly dealing with convergence in law) will be beneficial to understanding some of the intricacies of the topics and answer many of the 'whys'.In conjunction with the course and the book, I worked problems in R with the 'survival' package, which I found very useful. (R is a free statistical program. A basic understanding of R would be necessary before trying to use the survival package -- I would recommend Dalgaard's book for an intro to R if this is of interest.) I have a good understanding of R and found the survival package documentation supplemented by rseek . org searches (when I got stuck) sufficient to figure out how to implement the survival functions in R.On the example setup and problems...at the end of each chapter, this book is a bit hit-or-miss. Some problems are good. Many are not. There is a lot of confusion created by some of the problems, which leads into the part of the book I take the most issue with. The authors refer to scattered examples in problems (take for example, referring to example 8.3 in problem 9.5). The thing is, Example 8.3 starts on page 251 and then it continues randomly throughout the remainder of the chapter until page 274 (I had to page through the chapter to find those page numbers). The examples in mid-to-late chapters can be very scatter-brained and some of the problems start to become this way as well. The authors seem to forget that keeping track of the 15-20 studies they use in this text is no small task and that they've spent a lot more time looking at them than others. Self-contained examples where I don't need to flip back to chapter 1 or some other example to read about the study would be really nice.

"Although this text does not have the pretty layout and fancy pictures that some other epidemiology books have, it contains a wonderful wealth of information.  An excellent feature of the book is that it integrates statistical analysis with epidemiology, and in my view the two are on one continuum. The sections of the text that I have read have been clearly written. I'm a professor who teaches epidemiology at the senior undergraduate and graduate level.  I find that the standard much-used text by Gordis is superficial in comparison to the Woodward text.  The third edition of Epidemiology: Study Design and Data Analysis includes satisfactory coverage of many recently advanced important topics, such as meta-analysis, risk scores and prediction modeling, analysis of longitudinal data, propensity scoring, use of bootstrap estimations, and multiple imputations for missing data. Although many of these seem to be advanced topics, they are introduced and developed in an approachable fashion useful even for Masters level students. This text may overwhelm undergraduate students, who are taking one course in epidemiology and who may not go on to do further studies in this area.  I do recommend this text for those who are seriously interested in epidemiology and related statistical analyses, in particular, graduate students who plan to specialize in epidemiology.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Epidemiology: Study Design and Data Analysis Third Edition (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)

But the first time around it was too challenging and demotivating to say the least. Also, there may be less maths, but it is heavy on using the old greek letters with about 10 subscripts/superscipts clinging on to them somewhere.This isn't a bad book overall and I like the idea of not focusing on the maths, but think this is best read AFTER having gone through those books.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Analysis of Economic Data

While the concept and practice of Functional Data Analysis is extremely important this book isn't the way to learn it or to learn to use the Matlab implementation.  The book is written almost exclusively using R notation with Matlab functions stuffed in as an afterthought.  I admit that I'm not a fan of R but I have many years of experience using Matlab.  The examples often fail to define locally what the entries mean or even why you would use specific kinds of entries.  Aside from the failings of this book all of the books that have anything to do with Ramsay's input have exactly the same examples.  This is the worst possible practice if making the concepts clear is the goal.  A few additional simple examples different from the main examples would be extremely helpful.

"This is the bible for anyone doing dyadic research. Within the social sciences, researchers are collectively beginning to realize the importance of acknowledging interdependence in their data to conduct more meaningful statistical analyses, whether it be a simple mixed-measures ANOVA, MLM, of SEM. The authors do a fine job explaining why interdependence is important to account for and what happens if you ignore it. They follow it up with techniques of analyzing dyadic data using various statistical procedures. It helps going into this book if you are comfortable with some statistical nuts and bolts, such as the theory behind hypothesis testing and analyses of variance.

"I'm a software engineer who knows his way through SQL, mostly running queries/transforms on Postgres and Redshift. The majority of my background is in building and supporting services. Having no background knowledge in Spark, I was looking for a book that explains the fundamental concepts, helps me get up running, and helps me expand my toolkit for working with ""big data"".I was able to follow along in this book fairly easily. Working on a MacBook, I did have to first install Scala, download Spark, enable Spark in IntelliJ, etc. I didn't have trouble with this as it was fairly straightforward. With my environment set up, I found the book presents every code sample in Scala and Python. I worked through the code samples, chapter by chapter, writing Scala in IntelliJ or sometimes writing Scala in the Spark CLI itself.I did take a detour from the book slightly to learn a bit more about sbt, which is the Scala build tool.For a beginner such as myself, this book is a God send, but I do wish the authors approached some things differently.In my opinion, some topics are covered in a very ""hand-wavy"" manner. For example, Chapter 4 discusses managed vs. unmanaged tables. While knowing this difference exists is helpful for the reader, the authors never discuss when you should use a managed table or an unmanaged table. They could have included that information or pointed the user to some external source. This part of Chapter 4 then shows sample code on how to create a managed table from a CSV file. However, it's not clear what should I do with that information. What are the patterns applicable to a managed table vs. unmanaged table? What are the trade-offs? Being a beginner book, I still feel the authors could have written even just 1 page, which would add significant value to this section.Sometimes the book will share some interesting tidbit but using terminology or concepts that the authors haven't really described. I found this very frustrating. For example:> (Chapter 4, page 92) ... you can create multiple SparkSessions within a single Spark application—this can be handy, for example, in cases where you want to access (and combine) data from two different SparkSessions that don’t share the same Hive metastore configurations.If you search for mentions Hive, you see the authors briefly mentioned Spark uses a Hive metastore to persist table metadata. So are the authors saying I can use one Spark installation and access table metadata from different Hive metastores? Why would I ever want to access only the metadata for different tables? Again – the use case isn't clear.As a beginner, I found this book very valuable, and I believe it is a great investment.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Data Analytics
"The book is very easy to follow and the first five chapters get you up and running. I recommend getting the databricks community edition to type in the examples. That way you can focus on learning Spark instead of trying to work with all the infrastructure considerations. Chapter 6 is very relevant, if you are a scala dev you can get into the weeds there. There's even a chapter dedicated to Delta lake which I think is a must read. The MLlib/ Mlflow chapters are pretty much for the novice, so it's a good segue for the data engineer to get a gentle intro to ML. Overall I highly recommend the book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Data Analytics
"The foreword and preface to this book comment that an update to the first edition, published in 2015, was long overdue. After all, the first edition makes use of Apache Spark 1.3.0, whereas this update makes use of Apache Spark 3.0.0-preview2 (the latest version available at the time of writing). For the most part, I successfully ran all notebook code out of the box using Databricks Runtime 7.6 ML (includes Apache Spark 3.0.1, Scala 2.12), albeit minor issues are explained later in this review alongside my resolutions to these. I was, however, able to successfully run all standalone PySpark applications from chapters #2 and #3 out of the box using Apache Spark 3.0.1 and Python 3.7.9. As explained, the approach used here is intended to be conductive to hands-on learning, but with a focus on Spark's Structured APIs, so there are a few topics that aren't covered, such as the following: the older low-level Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) APIs, GraphX (Spark's API for graphs and graph-parallel computation), how to extend Spark's Catalyst optimizer, how to implement your own catalog, and how to write your own DataSource V2 data sinks and sources.Content is broken down into 12 chapters: (1) ""Introduction to Apache Spark: A Unified Analytics Engine"", (2) ""Downloading Apache Spark and Getting Started"", (3) ""Apache Spark's Structured APIs"", (4) ""Spark SQL and DataFrames: Introduction to Built-in Data Sources"", (5) ""Spark SQL and DataFrames: Interacting with External Data Sources"", (6) ""Spark SL and Datasets"", (7) ""Optimizing and Tuning Spark Applications"", (8) ""Structured Streaming"", (9) ""Building Reliable Data Lakes with Apache Spark"", (10) ""Machine Learning with MLlib"", (11) ""Managing, Deploying, and Scaling Machine Learning Pipelines with Apache Spark"", and (12) ""Epilogue: Apache Spark 3.0"". The longest chapter is chapter #8, followed closely behind by chapters #3, #4, #5, and #10, and the most notebooks are provided for chapters #10 and #11, although this is largely due to individual notebooks dedicated to a variety of topics. This book is the fourth of four related books I've worked through, a couple years after the earlier three: ""Spark: The Definitive Guide"" (2018), ""High Performance Spark: Best Practices for Scaling and Optimizing Apache Spark"" (2017), and ""Practical Hive: A Guide to Hadoop's Data Warehouse System"" (2016). As I mentioned in an earlier review, if you are new to Apache Spark, these four texts will help enable your going in the right direction, although keep in mind that the related tech stack is evolving and you will obviously need to supplement this material with web documentation and developer forums, as well as to get hands-on with the tooling. Reading the earlier three books in opposite order of publication date enabled exposure to more current material sooner rather than later, but this was largely just a coincidence. Now that this new book is available, I recommend working through this one first. While I wouldn't discount ""Spark: The Definitive Guide"", because it provides content not in this new book and I personally think it flows better, use it very judiciously because it was created using the Spark 2.0.1 APIs.The only notebooks I wasn't able to successfully run out of the box are constrained to chapter #11. In notebook 11-3 (""Distributed Inference""), 11-5 (""Joblib""), and 11-7 (""Koalas""), FileNotFoundErrors were generated when attempting to use Pandas to read from CSV or Parquet files using ""read_csv()"" and ""read_parquet()"", respectively. In taking a look at what the community had to say, I discovered that this is a known issue, so I replaced these Pandas statements with ""spark.read.option(...).csv(""..."") and ""spark.read.option(...).parquet(""..."") instead, respectively, subsequently converting to Pandas using ""toPandas()"". In looking at the documentation, Pandas 1.0.1 is installed on both the CPU and GPU clusters for the aforementioned Databricks Runtime (the latest non-beta currently available). In notebook 11-3 (""Distributed Inference""), the following PythonException was generated when attempting to execute a ""mapInPandas()"" statement that uses a mix of numeric data types in the schema argument: ""pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert 3.0 with type str: tried to convert to double"". In the absence of decent community guidance, and because this statement is solely used for display purposes, I simply converted all of these data types to ""STRING"". According to the documentation, Pyarrow 1.0.1 is installed on both the CPU and GPU clusters for the aforementioned Databricks Runtime. I personally got the most value out of chapters #7 and #8. Chapter #7 covers optimizing and tuning Spark for efficiency, caching and persistence of data, Spark joins, and inspecting the Spark UI. Chapter #8 covers evolution of the Apache Spark stream processing engine, the programming model of Structured Streaming, the fundamentals of a Structured Streaming query, streaming data sources and sinks, data transformations, stateful streaming aggregations, streaming joins, arbitrary stateful computations, and performance tuning. In particular, I especially appreciated the sections on the two most common Spark join strategies (the broadcast hash join and shuffle sort merge join), the Spark UI, stateful streaming aggregations, and streaming joins.

"This is a strange book in terms of its target audience.The book's focus of the first two-thirds is surveying the tools and packages available in the scientific stack - numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, etc. This is the best part of the book, as it provides quick overviews of how the core functionality works with decent examples. I work in a bulge bracket bank, and I take this book to work with me every day to use as a reference - much of what I want to do in Python, there's going to be a section or example with which to build off of.This book sticks to the basics of Python and its packages. Each chapter in this book will have entire books written about the subject matter. But, like much in life, 20% of the effort yields 80% of the results. This is a book which will have you quickly working with the scientific stack because it's focus on the core 80% of what you need to know, not all the ins-ands-outs of any particular application or package.However, this book has a series of flaws in increasing order of severity:1. (Very mild, maybe not a flaw at all) There is little-to-no explanation of the actual finance. For example, when doing Monte Carlo simulations, the author generates geometric brownian motion sample paths using the euler discretization of the SDE under the risk-neutral measure. I find it hard to believe that someone without prior background knowledge would be able to understand what the author is doing. This may not be an issue, as this is a Python book and not a finance book, but it does limit the potential readership - those of us with a solid foundation in finance, including stochastic calculus, but with only a limited knowledge of basic python. I don't believe there are too many people out there like this. I was transitioning from using R as my primary language, and so the book made sense for me.2. (Moderate) The Algorithmic Trading section seems to require that you make an account with the FXCM platform and place actual trades. Others have claimed that such an account requires thousands of dollars, which I'm simply unwilling to pay. I need to do more looking into this, but I would much prefer a free sandbox account with which to pull and work with historical data.3. (Severe) Portions of the code don't work from my experience. I cannot get the Pymc3 package to work, as I and many other first-time users encounter an endless string of errors and version conflicts. The authors of the package say to use their installation steps, but those have not yielded better results. The tensorflow code in this book is for the outdated version. This book gives scikit-learn examples with outdated parameters. In general, I'm pretty unforgiving when a book has entire sub-sections which need to be skipped.As an introduction to the scientific stack, the first 460 pages are decent enough and can be used as a basic reference. But this book as disappointed me in the back end. Moreover, you will need to have some prior finance background to follow the book in it's entirety.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Finance: Mastering Data-Driven Finance
Very good book,5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Finance: Mastering Data-Driven Finance
"""Python is the programming language and technology platform of choice, not only for this book but for almost every leading financial institution.  However, Python deployment can be tricky at best and sometimes even tedious and nerve-wracking.  Fortunately, several technologies that can help with the deployment issue have become available in recent years.""  Python for Finance, page 56.Dr. Hilpisch's book is an end to end explanation and demonstration of the complete process of setting up and using Python for financial data science.He begins with selection of software and installation on either a local computer or on cloud facilities.  He has chosen a set of software packages that are fully compatible with each other, easily installed, open source and free, well documented, and well supported.The next few chapters review the structure and use of Python.  The examples are well chosen and clearly explained.  Real financial data is used when possible.  He addresses the criticism that Python is slow by showing that alternative methods -- sometimes as simple as rewriting a single line of code -- can result in significantly improved execution speed.Analysts spend large portions of their time and effort on data preparation.  Beginning with real financial data, well chosen examples show how to inspect, clean, transform, and display data series.Analysis of risk and opportunity requires understanding of the distributions involved.  Dr. Hilpisch devotes several chapters to Monte Carlo analysis.  Illustrative examples include pricing of derivatives.The sections of the book that discuss algorithmic trading use the FXCM platform.  FXCM focuses on currency pairs, along with a few global indexes and a few commodities.  The raw historical data is ticks -- each a bid/ask pair.  The FXCM API provides tools to form OHLC bars of whatever length is desired.  The text provides examples using the raw ticks as well as the consolidated bars in trading systems.  The API also allows order placement and management.  A free demo account allows access to downloading data (1 minute bars and longer) and testing trading.Several trading systems are illustrated.  These range from very simple moving average crossover to machine learning.Profitable trading systems have, at their core, trade secrets.  As it does not contain secrets, this book will be of little value to readers hoping to read one book and be rich by Wednesday.  You will need to supply your own secret techniques for selection of auxiliary variables, data transformations, and target definition.  With those in hand, this book will clarify your path and speed your development.  It is exceptionally well done and highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Finance: Mastering Data-Driven Finance
"So first, my motivation for buying this book -- after reading tons of articles about algorithmic trading, I took the bait and decided to buy this book to learn more about how to apply programming to investment analysis.  I took a home study course in Python a couple years ago, and (with references back to ""Python Crash Course"") was able to follow along with the examples in this book through Ch 7.  I found Dr. Hilpisch quite straightforward and generally easy to follow, again with some reference back to my Python book and similar websites.I then hit a wall in Ch 8, which is on Financial Time Series.  You of course need data to perform this type of analysis, and this book chose to use Thomson Reuters Eikon Data API (application programming interface) from which to retrieve historical data.  The problem is that this site is not free, and the cheapest subscription is $3,600/yr.  If I worked for a financial services firm, this software would probably be a given, but as an individual investor this is not realistic.I do have an account with a popular online broker, which has a free API, but the book does not specify what type of data is being pulled, in order to replicate the retrieval there.  I would suggest that the author simply share a sample data file(s) on his website to use for these chapters, in order to illustrate the concepts in the book.  Please don't assume we have professional grade data subscriptions, or at least spell it out in the book's description, if you do (similar to stating that some basic knowledge of Python and Finance is a prerequisite).The author does provide a web page address for the book in the preface (http://bit.ly/python-finance-2e), but it was not very helpful in overcoming the issue described above.I'm still covering the chapters that I can finish without retrieval from an API, but it's rather disappointing that one cannot follow along with much of the more interesting material, without having access to Thompson Reuters.My overall grade for this book is an ""A"" for the concepts covered and how well they are explained, but a ""D"" in terms of making live data available for those sections requiring it.

"For the targeted audience, the book teaches a lot about Python and regression analysis.Their coverage of the latter is surprisingly deep; especially within chapters 6 & 8 where they cover regularization methods and other advanced regression methods.  Theoretical subjects such as how to treat outliers, overfitting vs underfitting, bias vs. variance, and many other topics are covered in a top-notch professorial manner.Their specific explanation of what the various main packages do is excellent.  The numerous examples using either statsmodels or scikit-learn are very good.For my part, the book had a somewhat limited use because I work mainly with longitudinal data (econometrics time series).  Meanwhile, the authors demonstrated regressions mainly using panel data (at the end they show a time series analysis which is not a full fledge multiple regression).  Also, I found the coding at times burdensome (standardizing variables and graphs demanded a lot of codes).  This may be in part due to the Python language itself.  I come from R that is far more efficient for regression modeling.The book has a few questionable statements that do not detract from its overall quality.  On pg. 39, the authors indicate that variables have to be standardized to get representative correlations.  That’s inaccurate.  I have tested this assumption with 10 different macroeconomic variables on different scales.  And, I got the exact same correlation matrix whether the variables were in their original transformation or standardized.  On pg. 51, the authors indicate that kurtosis is centered around 0.  Within Python statsmodels, it is actually centered around 3.  On page 132 & 133, when they either standardize or normalize variables to run regressions, based on the coding it seems that they only do so for the Xs variables and not for Y.  If that is the case, that’s not a good model specification.  On pg. 216, the explanation of stepwise forward selection seems inaccurate (in step 2, they indicate all other variables are projected on the first one selected; but, instead all other variables are correlated to the residual of the model using the first selected variables.  And, you select the variable that has the highest absolute correlation with the mentioned residuals).In conclusion, this is a good book on the subject.  Just like for any programing language, you don’t learn from just a single source.  You will find yourself studying books, on-line documentation, YouTube videos, and maybe take online courses.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Regression Analysis with Python

"If you are looking for an _applied_ guide to using R's lmer and the lme4 package for your repeated measures/longitudinal analyses, you are home. This book is really, really great.I came to this text comfortable with both R and mixed models, but I have had no formal guidance using the lme4 package or its predecessor (nlme). I had a hard time finding any easily-digestible information about appropriate coding conventions for lme4. I found the free R code for this textbook online, and it was great! Then I started reading the textbook online (some portions are available for free on Google Books). At that point, I realized that I just had to have the full book in my hands. It was that useful, and very readable. I was tired of scrounging around on the R message boards. I needed one-stop shopping - and nearly everything I need is in this book. The only thing missing is a thorough discussion of assumption violations and subsequent approaches should they arise. I guess Long assumes you have thorough knowledge of how to test and correct for assumption violations in R already, which could be an issue for readers.I am no stats or math whiz, and I don't have a thorough or fluent understanding of the inner mathy workings of mixed models or of the lme4 package, so I can't provide any critique of the text on those grounds. Hopefully someone else will provide some notes there. For what it's worth, I can say that I did some reading on the R message boards prior to purchasing this book, and nothing I've read in Long violates anything I read/skimmed by Douglas Bates or Ben Bolker (the authors of lme4).

"I bought this book as a companion guide to a SQL course on O'Reilly. I could have used the ebook for free, but I'm tactile and seem to learn faster when using a paper book than an ebook. The book walks you through the installation of a working environment, including PostgreSQL, Python, and a text editor such as VS Code, Atom, Notepad++, or Sublime Text. The book is straightforward and guides the reader through creating databases and tables on PostgreSQL. When finished, the reader will have a very nice skill set to apply toward data retrieval from almost any database. I haven't run the examples on a MAC because I do not own one. However, with no issues, I have run the example code in my Proxmox virtual lab hosted on Debian 11, Ubuntu 20, RHEL 8.6, Windows 10, Windows Server 2019, and on my Microsoft Surface 2 using Windows 11, Hyper-V, VirtualBox, and VMWare Workstation 16.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical SQL 2nd Edition: A Beginners Guide to Storytelling with Data
"A concise presentation of the basics.  This is a good thing if you are already familiar with some of the concepts and just want a quick, organized guidebook to follow.  However, this is a bad thing if you need more complete explanation, as you might expect from a book that presents itself as ""A Complete Beginner Guide"".The book itself leaves many things to be desired.  In particular, it is full of grammatical mistakes and other typographical problems.- The text uses “curly quotes” throughout, even in code samples, which will crash every version of Python that exists.  (Why didn't the author turn OFF the ""use smart quotes"" option in his word processor??)- There are many places where the quotation marks aren't even quotes, but are rather the guillemet characters « » that are used in France and elsewhere.  Try typing those in on a keyboard that doesn't have them!  A beginner will be confused, and might even try to type them as << and >>, which will definitely crash Python.- Code examples are line-wrapped, often in odd places, without any explanation or indication.  This can be exceedingly frustrating to a beginner, especially in a language like Python that depends on indentation and white space for its semantics.- Code samples (especially in the exercises) are often shown in a non-monospaced font, making them really confusing at times.  Other code samples are in a nice monospaced font.  Why not be consistent, and use monospaced throughout for code samples?- There are many places in the book that refer to ""Further Readings"".  Most of these contain links to something on the Web.  But, my book is on paper.  Links don't work on paper.  For example: on page 66 there is an infobox that says ""This free book presents..."".  The words ""This free book"" are underlined, and are obviously a link.  but, the URL is not printed.  I can't click a link on a printed page.

 There are a wide variety of programming languages being popularly used in human’s life. Recently, I have been looking up data analysis as well as Python because I have a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence field which is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.Thus, I decided to look for some books related to these topics so that I could understand how it works, and acknowledge to every aspect of the language. After that, I found out this one of the most valuable books in my bookshelf named that “Python Crash Course for Data Analysis” published by Al Publishing.In short, this book is very useful for anyone who want to learn the fundamental concepts, theory, examples, and hands-on projects related to Data Analysis using Python.There are eight chapters which contain the massive sources of information of Data Analysis so it is also very comprehensive and clear in each of chapter read. Besides, readers will have a chance to practice by exercises after several chapters, such as chapter 3 and 4. It is true that this book is very great for beginners who have not studied this programing language because the author guides you to walk slowly from basic information to the advanced knowledge carefully. In the first chapter, the author’s method to explain the importance of Python and using this book makes me very impressive to follow, understandable to learn the basic knowledge so far.In addition, the author also instructs readers to install the application to practice the programming language directly in their computers. For sure, every chapter plays a crucial role to develop your knowledge of Data Analysis using Python but I reckon that the chapter three is very important because it covers the basic concept of Python. Additionally, readers are able to learn how to use the types of basic data, variable assignment so if readers want to work through the entire book and develop the skills in Data Analysis, they should master all of the basic knowledge before they hit to the harder other parts. In this book, the author also attached the several examples of packages which begun with the NumPy libraries, then develop it to Pandas, Spicy, Matplotlib, etc. so readers can be successful at learning in the high quality and fast algorithm.Obviously, before someone would like to study this field or major, I suggest that readers should prepare the mathematic knowledge for themselves because in the advanced parts, they readers have to practice the functions, sets or inequality signs in order to create them by Python language with example and samples.Admittedly, I admire this author because his ability in teaching to help the beginners to study this complex knowledge of Data Analysis. Therefore, I would recommend the “Python Crash Course for Data Analysis” to anyone who are studying in the majors related to computer science, even in economy, engineering.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Crash Course for Data Analysis: A Complete Beginner Guide for Python Coding NumPy Pandas and Data Visualization (Machine Learning & Data Science for Beginners)

"This is probably not for total beginners.  For someone who has programmed before, specifically in Python and specifically for data science use, this is a great collection of code examples to work through and have on hand for when you get your real data put in.  A great review/refresher, and now I have a collection of code snippets to copy paste as needed.It uses mostly data examples from several of the packages, which have all been perfectly wrangled.  Data munging is perhaps beyond the scope of this book, but it is a critical skill to for a beginner to at least be aware of.  This book has perfectly behaved data sets; which is logical, in order to show how things 'should' work.Many of the packages covered do the same thing as each other.  Python with numpy and pandas are essential, but then seaborn, bokeh, and plotly all do very similar, but beautiful, things with the example data.  It was nice to be introduced to them.The final chapter is a good capstone project walk-through and review of concepts.  ""Intermediates"" might have been a better word to describe the people this book is aimed at, but even then... it does present beginner level concepts to specific packages/add-ons.

"This is a great book with some minor issues. I love how they use nontrivial examples. The kind of examples you can tweak the code a bit right out of the book and use it at work and look like a superstar. My dislike is that they didn’t focus on a single language, or segregate the different languages into dedicated duplicated chapters. Do pymc3 in the book and tensorflow probability in the online materials. Or vice versa. I understand their goal was to get readers to get familiar with multiple packages, but it’s a bit of a headache.  There are quite a few typos and misspellings.All that aside, I think this book is worth the money, and I can’t wait for the second edition.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)
"This is a great intro book to get started with Bayesian stats and probabilistic programming. It’s also pays a lot of attention to model diagnostics and the intricacies of Bayesian modeling.

Even so, this book will get you jump started with pymc and probabilistic programming.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)
"I've either read or own nearly all the Bayesian textbooks on the market. They range in presentation from too simple to esoteric and mathematical without clear sense of their application. To date the stand out textbook on the market was McElreath's statistical rethinking... it hits the sweet spot of mathematically rigorous and well written, but hides some of the messier computational details behind a custom R package.What's great about this book is that it is so focused on conveying the essentials of how-to applied computation. The authors make the choice to demonstrate a range of increasingly complex models across two distinct probabilistic programming languages (pymc, tensorflow probability), which forces the reader to grapple with the applied difficulties of shape management and model specification. The  variation of presentation is aided by a free online book with clear code examples and beautiful visuals (generated with Arviz). I was initially sceptical of the choice to use multiple ppls but by presenting two implementation options the reader is forced to focus on what is core to Bayesian  computation rather than details of a specific APIA previous review called this an entry level text, but I'm not sure that does it justice. Some of the examples are of simple datasets but the book is pitched to teach you the mechanics and the whys and wherefores of a Bayesian workflow so you can apply them creatively on your data. I was particularly grateful for the clear discussion of Approximate Bayesian Computation and the Timeseries modelling. The emphasis and attitude to prior and posterior predictive checks for model calibration was well put throughout the text. Plus the code is in Python! This is a big plus for me as I've never worked anywhere where the production environment would tolerate R code...I highly recommend this book as it fills a niche in the market and is cluttered with the wisdom of practiced Bayesian modellers. Somewhat different in tone than the more academic offerings on the market, more focused and practical.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)
"I have purchased the textbook as an Amazon Kindle format on Amazon.CONS:- Amazon Kindle is making impossible to save a PDF copy of the book for Amazon's silly DRM policies. However, scientific textbooks would read better as PDFs instead of a Kindle format. Really disappointed how CRC Press (headed by Taylor & Francis press) has decided to rely on Amazon Kindle. For the record, Cambridge University Press is adopting the same DRM protected policy, unfortunately. DRM policies clearly are blocking scientific research. The choice of selling a DRM protected textbook sounds awkward since the first author (Osvaldo Martin) has published his previous textbook in 2016 (""Bayesian analysis with Python"") with Packt press. At Packt they are brave enough to offer DRM-free material. Why Mr Martin has changed his mind in his second textbook?- The formulas are poorly written (mathematically correct, but the style is bad). They need to be rewritten in LaTeX. Perhaps the hardcover version is better. I did not check it.PRO:- The textbook successfully delivers the promises of the first textbook from 2016: very intuitive explanations of complex statistical concepts; few mathematical formulas; lots of concrete examples; gorgeous plots;- it is worth mentioning the useful accompanying site (https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/) where you can find plenty of well written Python code about the plots and analyses presented in the book;CONCLUSION:In terms of ""entry level"" Bayesian modeling, I think this textbook (Martin et al. 2022, ""Bayesian Modeling and computation in python"") and McElreath's textbook (Richard McElreath 2020 ""Statistical rethinking"") are the best ones out there.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)

"As far as introducing the data structures this book takes a great visual approach. Algorithms are often easiest to understand in animated form but the step by step of this book is quite strong.The major weakness is by jumping between JS, Python, and Ruby you never fully develop any of them. Although the programmatic style is mostly translatable between these three languages it’s still typically better to do one thing fully rather than a few things partially. My feeling is that Ruby was the most represented of the three.All in all worth a read for the visualizations of the structures and algorithms.",4.0 out of 5 stars,A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills
"I was by no means “a beginner” when I picked up this book. But it’s also been 20 years since I learned anything DS&A. I picked this book over others mostly on a whim, but being geared towards beginners, I was at least assured that the subject material would fly over my head.So don’t get me wrong, this is a fantastic, educational book. My complaint is against how the author chose to interject his explanation of the code. My feeling is that he’s taken away part of the book for those like me who don’t need (and can’t stand) highly-commented code. Heck, I’m okay if there were just a few, well-worded, well-placed comments that gave reasons for unclear aspects of the code. But at about a quarter through, I stopped trying to read too much of the code. It just gave me a headache trying to parse code from comments. When it’s all “black and white,” it just blurs together.Then, once you’re done trying to find the code amongst the comments, realize it’s maybe 6 lines of code, he says, “This code is not trivial, so let’s break it down.” Dude. You already did that. In the middle of the code. Using comments. And also. My man. Six lines is very nearly the _exact_ meaning of trivial. Non-trivial is when you need to create classes and use _actual_ programming techniques of architecture and design. Not writing 6 lines of code that you didn’t even write tests for because you’re not the first person to write it that way, in that language.So if you can get past the frustration involved with that aspect, the actual DS&A part is amazingly good and easy to understand. I’ve recommended the book on more than one occasion; I only mention the code comments when I think it’ll benefit the person to whom I’m recommending the book.I would certainly enjoy a second, less beginner-focused version that maybe expands on the concepts, or even repeats some with more succinct code/comments.",4.0 out of 5 stars,A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills

Some examples are given in Python which is sensible, and if the whole book used Python I’d have no issues translating the exercises to a new language.This honestly might just be a shortcoming on my part but I wouldn’t recommend this book if you don’t regularly use Ruby or don’t already understand the concepts being taught and how to implement them.",3.0 out of 5 stars,A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills

"This book is an introductory-level statistics textbook for people who are learning statistics for the first time, and who know some math but are not math wizards.I am outright shocked at the low reviews given to this book.  I tend to be highly critical of statistics textbooks, especially ones at this level.  In my opinion, this book does an outstanding job.  It balances making the material accessible with going into considerable depth, and it integrates mathematical theory with an emphasis on data analysis.  The title of this book says it all: ""Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis"".  There are few other books that emphasize both theory and practice.  This book certainly lives up to its title in this respect.Perhaps some of the bad reviews are from frustrated students who are in classes that are moving too quickly for their level.  Just because this is an excellent book doesn't mean that every professor will use it in an appropriate way.  The exercises in this book can be tough and I think it would be possible to easily overwhelm students by assigning too many problems or problems that are too difficult.  This book is only really useful if you are able to explore it at a slower pace, reading it and reflecting on it.---This book is not concise but it is not overly wordy.  Rice is an excellent writer.  The expanded discussion communicates aspects of the subject that are often overlooked, and helps build the students' intuition.  This book is always readable and it is clearly written to be read and understood.  In addition to communicating basic concepts, the book also explores numerous practical and philosophical considerations.  For a book at such an introductory level, this text is remarkably deep.One of the most attractive aspects of this book is that it is relatively easy to skip around in it.  More advanced students or students with some exposure to probability will necessarily want to skip many of the early chapters.  Unlike some of the more advanced texts (such as the Casella and Berger) where the chapters depend on and reference each other in a rather rigid fashion, this book is more flexible and thus can appeal to students with diverse backgrounds.My last bit of praise is the integration of data analysis with mathematical theory.  Distributions are introduced with a rich discussion of where, how, and why they arise in practice.  Data analysis techniques, tests, and abstract definitions alike are introduced in such a way that they are rooted both to the abstract theory and to consideration of applications: this book is one of the rare texts that fully bridges the gap between the real world and the abstract models used to describe it.I would recommend this book for a wide variety of different uses.  This would make an outstanding textbook and it could easily be used for more than one course, or for courses at more than one level.  It is a useful book to have on the shelf as a basic reference, and it is also very useful for self-study.  My only complaint is that more books in the field of statistics are not written in the spirit and style of this one.  In particular, I would like to see authors of more advanced books examine this book's strengths and use them to enhance their own writing.  Or perhaps John Rice ought to try his hand at writing a higher-level text; I know I would be eager to see what he could produce!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis (with CD Data Sets) (Available 2010 Titles Enhanced Web Assign)
"This book is quite difficult despite the fact that the mathematical background to read this book is pretty modest:  The mathematical background needed, strictly speaking, is such that someone at a junior college level would be adequately prepared.  Furthermore, the book repays the effort to work with it.This book has a number of really strong attractive features.  The proofs are kept short and informal, and focus as much on developing intuition, as on getting the rigor needed to appreciate a theorem.  Certainly, this is necessary for statistics which is an unusual field that does not quite fit in pure math, or applied math, or science, and yet contributes powerfully to a very broad spectrum of fields.The author presents very intuitive and accessible accounts of certain other topics, notably Bayesian statistics and bootstrap methods.  I had had no exposure to non-parametric statistics, and found the book's treatment to be very helpful.  Another notable feature was to present the same examples from different points of view as the book progressed.  This, I think, has the potential to be somewhat confusing to the student, because one must continually refer back to past examples.  Overall, such a struggle does seem to improve learning a little, so it is not a total pain.I solved all problems in Chapter 2, and have started on Chapter 3's problems.  Solving the problems significantly improved my level and my knowledge of Statistics.  However, solving all problems in a chapter is very time consuming, especially when one works in isolation.I found reading the book to be demanding, and I often had to refer back to preceding sections that I had read.  I felt I learned a lot from this book, and can highly recommend it, both for its depth and its broad coverage.  Bear in mind that, even though the assumed math background is modest, this is a serious, relatively deep book.  It will open your eyes to the wonder and beauty of mathematical statistics, and whetted my appetite to go on to more advanced studies.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis (with CD Data Sets) (Available 2010 Titles Enhanced Web Assign)
"I am a second year graduate student (MS Statistics, with a BS in Mathematics) using this book in a required theory course.  I think this book is awful, and that is coming from a 2nd year student with a 4.0 GPA and a strong A in the course.  I can't imagine using this thing as an introductory text for undergrads, as Rice recommends in the preface.  The reading is dense and the examples are all over the place.  Rice seldom walks you from the theory to the application; that is largely left to students in the form of end of chapter problems to figure out how on earth this stuff gets applied.  It is only because I have already completed a full year of graduate level theory work that I can follow what is going on here, and I find myself frequently referencing those previous texts for thorough explanations (esp. Tanis & Hogg).For example in my most recent reading, in one proof the author switches over to using logs, without explanation.  I happen to know when & why you can do this thanks to previous course work, but how is an introductory level student supposed to follow when logs just start appearing with a paltry explanation like ""It's easier to work with logs""...??End of chapter problems are unduly laborious and burdensome, and seem to emphasize mathematical trickery over cultivating an understanding of the concepts.To me, this example sums up the book: in the Appendix list of distributions, he doesn't give you the chi-square distribution; rather he just tells you it's a gamma with θ = 2 and α = r/2.  So every time you're in a pinch and just need chi-square to work out some problem, you have to sit there and take the extra step of evaluating & simplifying gamma at those parameters.  Extend that idea of making the student work everything out at every turn to the rest of the book, and that's what you're in for.In short, this is a classic example of ""A great Statistics Book for people who already understand Statistics"".  If you have infinite time to sit around and grind through this and work it all out, then fine, you might enjoy, but for the rest of us this book is a bust.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis (with CD Data Sets) (Available 2010 Titles Enhanced Web Assign)
"I found this book frustrating and very disappointing. I was looking for a literate, calculus-based introductory text. IMHO, this is an awful book for self-study, unless one is a profoundly gifted math student who can figure it all out for him/herself.Important results are frequently presented without justification or any deep intuition / motivation. Some results simply reference an unsolved problem from the end of a previous chapter!Contra Alex Zorach's review, Rice is certainly not an excellent writer, in the sense of ""excellent explainer"" (as one would expect the author of a textbook to be). To give one typical example : Rice's introductory remarks on covariance (section 4.3) offer very minimal explanation for where the formula comes from. Here's Rice:""You may find this material somewhat formal and abstract at first, but as you use them, covariance, correlation, and their properties will begin to seem natural and familiar.""This is way below my standards, anyway, for excellence in technical writing. Essentially Rice is saying ""I can't explain why this formula is what it is. Just 'shut up and calculate', as the old saying goes. You'll get used to it and soon won't be asking why.""For comparison : Google ""covariance intuition"". You'll find several helpful discussions on Stack Exchange and elsewhere.Unfortunately, the only excellent, introductory statistics texts I've found are non-calculus-based. For example, Bock et al ""Stats"" (for High School AP stats courses) is written with a very good sense of where the student is, and what kind of explanations really make sense. Significantly, that text has three, award-winning authors. Rice would have done much better had he found a good co-author who both understands the college freshman mindset and has a real interest in breaking down the math for the student's benefit.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis (with CD Data Sets) (Available 2010 Titles Enhanced Web Assign)

"I'm a junior at UCBerk who took a comprehensive stats survey course that used this book (more specifically, ch. 7 onwards, the earlier chapters on prob. were covered in a previous course). I thought the book was generally well-written but a little dense/ too terse at times. Maybe some improvements to clarity could be made: e.g. in chapter 8/9, more text could be included about the relation of usage of ""test statistic"" to likelihood ratio and their equivalence; in chapter 9 specifically, maybe more elaboration on the first opening example meant to explain hypothesis testing could be included (e.g. integration of the example with the following explanation of NP lemma, like using the example to explain power/t1 error asymmetry).

"Others have have already said that this book is superb and I completely agree.  If you have had a class that covers applied statistics (basic correlation and regression) you should be able to pick this up and read it with no trouble.  There is math here but is is *well* explained and the algebra is always presented with a worked example.The code at UCLA (sorry they will not let me post the link here) makes the incredibly good writing even more valuable because, not only will you understand the concepts behind Mixed Effects/Hierarchical Linear Models, you will be able to implement the ideas.  If you already have some experience with Mixed Effects/HLM browse the code and you will quickly see this book covers a wide scope.  I have worked with the SAS code a lot and even though the book is a bit old (by a programmer's standards) the code still works just fine.While the book is written to be clear for non-mathemeticians, there are many ""intermediate to advanced"" statistical topics covered here.  These are importantly areas which are typically unintelligible to non-statisticians or are glossed over or ignored by other authors.  Here are some noteworthy examples.  This book could/should be used as a text on data exploration and visualization.  There are many case-studies throughout the book and they all begin with great visualizations (with the all important code supplements showing the novice how to make the plots in the book).  Topics like fitting lines, splines, curves are covered clearly and are shown beautifully.  The discussion on choosing between sets of models using deviance (-2log likelihood) and AIC has the best coverage of any book.  The general discussion of likelihood estimation (maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood) is superb.  The coverage of data transformation for model fitting is explained well and is presented with wonderful plots.

This is a book for beginners in the sense that it emphasizes data analysis, rather than theory.  But every statistician, and every user of statistics, can find something of value.

"Wilke’s “Fundamentals of Data Visualization” fills an important niche: a manual for the professional data scientist who wants to convey the essence of data succinctly, accurately, and in an aesthetically pleasing way. Wilke shows that this is (perhaps surprisingly) difficult, and he does this by showing both good and bad examples of data visualization in order to make this point. The book really attempts to build up the reader’s intuition about what makes a good visualization chapter by chapter. By the end, the lessons learned have become so obvious that when going back to earlier chapters, a single glance at the figure is enough to remind you about what is good (or bad) in the example given. This is not a book that gives programming examples that tell the reader how to achieve a particular figure, and I think this is intentional. The emphasis is on understanding the principles of data visualization, not on supplying a hack for the next figure. (But for those who want to recreate a figure, Wilke provides the entire source code for the book on a web site). All in all, this is probably the best book on data visualization for the practicing scientist out there. The prose is clear and concise, the principles behind the choices he makes are clearly laid out, and the figures are clean and free of clutter.  My only gripe is that the colors in the book appear to be somewhat flat and less intense than in the electronic version. Hopefully this can be remedied in the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fundamentals of Data Visualization: A Primer on Making Informative and Compelling Figures
"As a working data scientist and recovering academic, I've been making data visualizations for a decade. I've read lots of books about data visualization, but there were few I found difficult to put down; this book has been an exception.The principles in the book are solid and agree with my experience: following the guidelines in the book will help you craft more meaningful figures that resonant more deeply with your audience and allow you the freedom to move away from the production of criminally overwrought visualizations that are so common in academia and elsewhere.In the process, Wilke gives very approachable, high-level forays into elementary statistics, PCA, and map projections that felt like welcome and complementary diversions. I would have liked to have read a bit more about how humans perceive different visualization types, plotting characters and the like and how empirical studies of human perception can inform our design of visualizations; this was sprinkled throughout the text but a chapter on it would have been welcome. But that's a minor point; the text is clear and the entire book is incredibly well thought-out.The code for all the figures, should you want it, is online; if you are an R user (note  that the book is language-agnostic), studying it will give you power to craft and tweak your figures to a degree to make even the Wickham's of the world jealous.

"Full disclosure: 3 years ago I became a colleague of Prof. Wilke at the University of Texas, and we have interacted occasionally since then although we are in different departments.  I recently purchased this book because of interest in the topic and my respect for Prof. Wilke and have not been disappointed.  I have taken the author's advice and have not read the book cover to cover but have been dipping into chapters of interest--but then I find myself hooked and reading further on.  The author's straightforward presentations and clear delineation between good, bad, and matters of opinion are helpful and spot on.  I am working on two scientific papers at the moment and found advice and discussions in the book that have improved figures in both papers--and I had previously prided myself on what I thought was a thoughtful approach to making figures.  I left the book with my students, and now a regular feature of our weekly journal club is a Wilke-inspired critique of how the figures could have been better made to illustrate the main point.

Having said that, I think the material could have been covered in more detail, in half the pages.I feel that you could look at the book table of contents, and find the material yourself for each chapter.Some complaints- book gives a lot of information (e.g. about the parameters of a function) in a long paragraph instead of a bullet form.- lot's of space (pages) filled with pointless tables, some longer than they need to be to make the point, all with normal size font.- lot of things are explained using some pretty big tables with hundreds or more rows.  Why ?  Author couldn't be bothered to make some smaller CSV files ?- Feels like the author has struggled to fill the pages in the book.  There is a chapter dedicated to STRING FORMATTING and REGEX .. nothing really to do with a Pandas book.  Other chapters give examples of things are that fairly obscure - such as all kinds of plots such as violin plots, instead of actually explaining plots in a concise manner -  or obscure cases that you would rarely encounter, and if you did, this book would not be a good reference either way.- Another example of filler material, Chapter 5 is about ""missing data"", and there's a section that shows you where it could come from, and chapter 5.3.2 ( 2 pages), is really an exact repeat of the tables from the section on merging .. because those examples tables contain missing data.  A simple paragraph pointing you to that previous section could have sufficed.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Pandas for Everyone: Python Data Analysis (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)
"I'm a Data Scientist for a large bank, also currently pursuing a Masters in DS. I've tried to slog through any number of Python/R/Data Science books and usually can barely crack the first 100 pages. First of all, they all seem to be compelled to drag me through numpy. I get it. Everything is based on numpy. But I rarely use numpy iRL! In short, most of the authors take 600 pages to say what they can easily get to in 200 and change.Daniel's book is a breath of fresh air. He still manages to educate without getting bogged down in the minutia or the overly verbose theory, math, etc. etc. The chapters cut right to the chase of what you need to know to become expert at pandas (as well as seaborn and other nifty libraries) while also providing Data Science-applicable foundations (tidy data, visualizations, etc.).Also worth mentioning is the companion information available on his github repo. I made great use of the Jupyter notebooks, adding copious examples from the book. These will be my go-to references going forward.I can honestly say I've never referred to a technical book as a ""page-turner"" but this one definitely fits that description. I averaged three chapters a day and will re-read it in about a month.

"Getting into the world of data analytics and data science can daunting. I’ve bought and partly read several books on Pandas, and read a lot of the usual blogs and stack overflow articles, however this book stands out in terms of having clear explanations and up to date examples, and a graded level of introduction where the author goes wide before he goes deep. He makes early use of data visualization which is a wonderful way to teach, as seeing the results of the analysis in a graphical way complements the tabular results from Pandas (which is a wonderful tool).I like this book so much it's becoming a little worn around the edges, as I take it with me while travelling on business (my day job is cybersecurity) and I can see many applications for pandas to summarize, present and search for outliers in a large amount of security data.Several topics which really confused me for a long time became clear in minutes with this book, which is a testament to a good writer - there are not just examples; there are the right examples that illustrate how to do something and the kind of trap you can fall into when you do it wrong.I've just bought the kindle version to complement my paper copy, something I rarely do, but this book is worth it!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pandas for Everyone: Python Data Analysis (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)

"Most of the reviews here are students complaining that they got assigned this book for class : ""I used to be an A student until I took my C++ course, therefore the book is to blame for my shortcomings.""  Totally unfair!If you read the front matter for this book, Weiss clearly states that this book is *NOT* meant as an undergraduate textbook; this book is meant for graduate students or advanced programmers.  If your instructor is using this book for an introductory C++ textbook, that's between you and your instructor.  Don't blame the author!This is one of the few books available that uses Modern C++ to cover C++ data structures.  Yes, it's difficult to work through the examples.  But, for the advanced programmer, this is what you want.  The code is terse, but very elegant.I like how the book shows the internals of STL classes like std::vector, std::list, and others.

"This is book is designed for a introduction to data structures and algorithm analysis but nothing more.  The college that I attend uses only the basic containers (vectors and dynamic arrays) but requires the student to hard code linked lists and the more advanced data structures.  This approach to programming, I believe, works best for most students (albeit a bit time consuming).As for understanding the algorithm analysis, most college require a more rigorous course to truly understand the changes to an algorithms running time.  You're not a ""wussie"" if you find the book difficult to read (as previously mentioned by other reviewers) but you must read the book, take the best information that holistically fills your knowledge gap, and ignore the rest that doesn't make sense.

I've seen the language is kind of muddy in some of the problems, and an earlier error, but I'm in chapter 16 solving problem 2 and the author not only mistakes the solution by using a wrong probability, but even in the solution writes full paragraphs of explanation that incorporate this incorrect result (i.e. not a simple math mistake). The actual answer is closer to 7.5 than 1.53, because you're using 0.83 (Schwan) and not 0.63 (earwax imp.) in calculating your P(D|H2).Anyway, great book, but if you are careful you will spot errors.

"The focus of my professional work is the development and analysis of trading systems.  My constant challenge is understanding, monitoring, and measuring the relationships between the model, the data it processes, the target it predicts, and the results it produces.Managing trading systems requires comparing real-time results with benchmarks, estimating risks, and adjusting position size.  Being able to estimate confidence intervals is critically important.  Bayesian analysis is the primary technique I use.Mr. Kurt clearly explains  how individual data values form distributions, and how the shape and metrics of the distributions change as new data is observed.  He outlines the theory underlying Bayesian analysis, carefully identifying each of the components and explaining how each is determined.  He describes calculation of credible intervals of confidence for means, and probabilities that the means of distributions are different.  The descriptions of techniques are clear and presented with a minimal amount of math.This book is an excellent introduction to the techniques used in modeling and managing trading systems.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way: Understanding Statistics and Probability with Star Wars LEGO and Rubber Ducks

Be warned though, this book is about a technical subject, and there are a lot of mathematical equations, which thankfully are walked through in the text.The author uses a lot of intuitive examples to illustrate the mathematics.

I always thought that the data from observations, quasi-experiments and simulation was all I had in working with the numbers; it never occurred to me that bringing in seasoned or experienced judgment through priors could formally and mathematically improve the probability of whatever I was estimating.  Now, I understand why the frequentist and the Bayesian views clash.  It was illuminating to have the tools to counter observations and data when you have other evidence to help in calibrating the final probability or posterior.

"Look, I'll be honest. I'm one of the few students that actually uses and appreciates textbooks. I don't like doing my reading online either because I like having a physical copy to mark, make notes in, and pass through. And I don't often groan about textbooks either. Sure, they're overwhelmingly boring. But for the most part, I find them useful (some more than others) and read them cover to cover. So to get me cranky about a textbook you have to do your fair share.And oh does Mark Allen Weiss deliver. The book is a complete nightmare. A great textbook is able to walk the reader through each part of the field he's learning, teaching it to him one piece at a time. I've always said if a textbook is great, you should be able to learn the subject from it without the aid of a teacher. Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java isn't even adequate or below par -- it's straight garbage. It's the sort of book that makes one thankful for the premise of Farenheit 451.The author frequently likes to explain things while missing out important steps in the logic -- steps which may be obvious to experts in the field, people who have been studying computer science and mathematics for a long time, or exceptionally keen students, but which will utterly befuddle the rest of us. His English is clunky. He has a very unique talent for phrasing things in the most non-intuitive way possible. Relatively simple topics become a nightmare.I've spent the semester spending hours on Khan Academy, Google, or in my instructor's office seeking clarification of topics because trying to learn from this book is utterly hopeless. I'm learning Data Structures just fine, but this book has only been an obstacle to that process, not a help.Do not waste your money on this garbage. You won't use it.

So far, my only complaint is that the reading seems ineffectively heavy such as when explaining what vertices and edges are in Graph Theory; vertices are nodes, or points in a graph, and edges connect vertices together, but the author in this textbook uses wordy paragraphs to explain vertices and edges; while some complex concepts do require detail descriptions, you shouldn't have to put any effort in comprehending basic concepts.

I found the question bank to be actively detrimental to my understanding and full of errors.The book itself is very good. It clearly explains the concepts for the exam and strikes a good balance between detail and not overwhelming the student.The problem is that the quizzes and practice exams included are not even close to the same quality. Between the questions where the ""correct"" answer directly contradicts the text, to those where an entirely made-up throwaway choice is somehow the right answer, to those where the explanation refers to a different question than what was asked, there's a massive dropoff in quality from the text itself.The Wiley website where the quizzes and tests are hosted (mandatory signup to access the two full practice tests and flashcards, optional for the chapter quizzes) is ok, although the registration process seems purpose-built to be annoying.Since Data+ is still a new exam as I'm writing this, there aren't a lot of study resources available.

"While no one should be limited to just one book, if I had to choose, this is the one book for rolling up my sleeves and actually doing Deep Learning.  It's also not overly long.  The authors carefully chose just the  necessary materials and not too much.  Each important concept is carefully explained.  Some of the concepts are covered multiple times, with progressive depth, as the chapters advance.  The book is chock full of Jupyter notebooks that you can use as templates with **your own data**.  You can swap out sections from one chapter with sections from other chapters to tailor it to **your** data project.  The Fastai library is an open-source Python packages used heavily in the book, also written by fast.ai.  It's there to help new data scientist get started faster.  It handles many of the common tasks in a data science project, and acts as an easier interface (API) to PyTorch, Pandas, and NumPy.  It also sets many hyperparameter with defaults that work in the majority of cases.  While later on, users can go straight to the PyTorch source, initially these defaults and the unified Fastai API saves a lot of time.While the authors say this is a good introduction to anyone with **1 year of Python coding experience,** I think it helps to have some traditional deep learning class exposure.  I took Coursera's Andrew Ng deep learning classes before, and that knowledge really helped.  This book is written top-down, which is opposite of traditional college classes, so it could be very confusing if you have not taken any traditional-style class in deep learning.  Also the heavy use of Fastai library makes the code more difficult to learn in some dimension, even though on net it saves a lot of learning time.  :-(  At times it's difficult to tell how to do the same thing in PyTorch without using Fastai as a front-end API.  You will need to learn how to do it all in PyTorch eventually (chapters 17, 18, 19), but not until you have several working projects under your belt.  So yes, it's the best one book for rapidly getting started and DOING real deep learning with your **own data.**  :-D**Update August 5., 2022:**There is a 2022 Spring version of class using this book on YouTube.

But the other example given for DataBlock api, I can confirm is not an error since I've ran that code many times.  I've also ran almost all of the code from chapters 1 to 12 during 2021.  I found only 2 code errors.  I led a Meetup group using this book.  Also, I recommend downloading the Jupyter notebooks from GitHub to get the latest version, but this would not have affected the error rate in the code during 2021, since both the book and Github code had the same version, dated August 2020.  Of course people should use books they like and enjoy!  And not everyone likes this book.In my experience in leading a Meetup group based on this book over 14 months, about 50% LOVE this book (75% experienced coders in some language and 25% brand new to 1 year Python coders).  About 25% HATE this book (half and half experienced and beginner coders), mainly because of the top-down teaching approach, and some people feel that using Fastai library hides too much of the code detail in part 1 (chp 1-10).  Straight PyTorch and bottom-up approach would have worked better for these people.  About 25% are in the middle.  They like the Fastai top-layer API library (a must for complete beginner coders)  and/or the top-down teaching approach.I fall into the ""will have the most hard time"" category according to Jeremy Howard at a Lex Friedman interview: About 1 year of full-time coding experience in Python without a deeper coding experience in other languages, and not a total beginner coder.  However, I appreciate the top-down teaching approach and Fastai library that offers an easier coding layer for beginners.  I had to read small parts of source code for Fastai library to understand DataBlocks API, but I learned about coding patterns and URL fetch commands too.  I think it requires more work for someone in my category (want to understand the code under the hood, but am not an experienced coder). For me, it was totally worth it.For a total beginner, this book and class is the only option to learn deep learning.  All other classes/books require some programming experience and especially Python programming experience (1 year minimum, 2 years recommended).  So I would completely recommend the Fastai book to a total beginner.  You may feel uncomfortable with the top-down teaching approach since most college classes are taught bottom-up.  But as long as you try to live with it, you can run cool deep learning projects by learning to use pre-built example notebooks, pre-trained models, and tutorial, and substituting the example data with your own.  Think of it as learning to drive a car on your highway of choice, instead of learning to build the engine first to race your car on formula one!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD
"What an amazing book! What an amazing venture Sylvain and Jeremy have undertaken!I've done parts of the fast.ai video course in the past. I was very excited that a book version was coming, and in this kindle edition they don't disappoint. For those who prefer written materials to videos, this will be an exciting release.I haven't finished all the materials in the book, but I've read a good way and while it's a different experience to doing the course online, I have been enjoying it so far. The book is well written, well thought-out and the ideas explored are interesting in and of themselves.For those who use kindle devices, I'm happy to report that the book opens on an old Kindle 2, as well as on iPad, iPhone and web versions of the Kindle reading application. Screenshots above are taken from the web version. You can see in one of them that the formatting is really well handled -- you can make highlights in the code samples. (Those of you who read technical books on their kindles will know that it is RARE that the publisher makes the effort to handle the formatting of these books properly -- quite often they just make images of the code snippets in the book, making for a bloated file size of the book and unusuable content from the perspective of the reader. Luckily this book is REALLY WELL FORMATTED. Thank you, O'Reilly (and Sylvain and Jeremy presumably as well, for their open-access formatting of the book which is on Github too)).I'll let others more knowledgeable than me comment on the content of the book, but for this early-stage deep learning student, this book is inspiring, clearly written and a great asset in my studies going forward.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD
"If the point of reading an introductory book on how to use machine learning or deep learning is to learn the concepts, then apply them and learn the language enough to be able to code new programs or do new exciting things with A.I., then this book fails.First, it oversells. It states that you don't need a degree in math, you don't need to be a programmer or a data scientist. Well, it might just mean you have to take some extra calculus or python classes before reading this book. And that is ok. That's not the worst part. And it would not be that bad if you could just copy the code and learn from it. If you could just type in word-for-word, symbol-by-symbol the code in the book but.... You will soon be met with frustration because the code that is written in this book is outdated and does not work. Two examples from early in the book are on page 161 about Stochastic Gradient Descent. The following code: params.data -= lr * params.grad.data will give an error code. Another code on page 70 about ""DataBlocks"" uses another bit of language, ""splitter=Random.Splitter(valid_pct=0.3,seed=42). This also does not work. I gave up trying to learn this crap at this point. Its hard enough learning Python, regex and the author's use of "".this"" and ""underscore_that"" to not have it work in the end. No wonder you can download the book off of GitHub. Its questionable if its worth the paper its printed on. If Jeremy Howard can fix his code to where it will work on a consistent basis without having to re-learn more stuff that will eventually become outdated as well, then he might have something here. If not, oh well. Someone else will come along and do just that.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD
"Jeremy and Sylvain take a top down approach to make deep learning more palatable for people who can code. You start by building a very simple app that does image classification and by the end of the book you'll have a good understanding of the layered fastai v2 API and pytorch itself. Really well put together. Good for people comfortable with tensorflow and those who have prior ML experience as this is an exciting way to keep your knowledge up to date.

"Last year I started my first project assignment on deep learning, and puzzled my way through it using Stack Overflow. It was a disjointed and somewhat awkward way to learn, but I did in fact get a lot of the basics. However, when I saw this book I suddenly realized it was past time to do some proper reading and learning on the topic, and fired off an order. Reading it now gives a series of 'oh yeah', and 'aha' moments, as it connects up various loose ends I'd come across and never properly registered. It's written in a semi-conversational style that is similar to how you'd get information from a co-worker, if you had a co-worker that was knowledgeable in deep learning. For example, it has a style where there's an occasional contra-example given to show what something ISN'T, alongside what it IS. I didn't have any such co-worker, but if I'd had this book instead of just stack overflow it would have been a big help. Highly recommended if your learning style is anecdotal, informal and driven by hands-on results.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Deep Learning: A Python-Based Introduction

"This book starts off slow, but goes into detail about PyTorch, tensors, back propagation, etc.  It is a great introduction to the field and helps to understand convolutions, resnets, etc.  One large basic component that it is currently lacking is a chapter on language models and attention.  Hopefully the second edition will include this information down the line. Finally, the networks here are mostly sequential.  The final example that takes part in the last half of the book is not incredibly useful in my opinion, but it does help to see a DL project all the way through.

Chapter 5 is where the mathematics of deep learning is presented but it is does very clearly using Python code/formulas.  It strikes a nice balance in theory and practice and is never boring.

"This book is one-of-a-kind in that it teaches you not just theory, but how to build different kinds of neural networks. I found the way he covered the chain rule and differentiating compositions of functions a bit lacking, however. He doesn't ever mention Jacobians and makes it more confusing than he needs to. The chain rule for composition of multivariate functions is not difficult when using Jacobians--you just need to multiply a chain of Jacobians in the correct order. He doesn't use this machinery, and has to sum some of his derivatives over columns because he doesn't define his derivatives in an intuitive way, using Jacobians.

The first chapter starts off alright but he often fails to explain himself or provide the full code. He also does not give you any intuition as to why it works like he says he will. He goes through a series of mathematical functions applied to some input step by step without saying at each step why this works. When I got to the second chapter and he starts referencing a jupyter notebook with code not in the book and importing sklearn datasets that's when I decided to leave a review. He mentions briefly that discussion of data is a topic for the future. I think data and neural networks are not separable.

And this book is jammed packed with insights, visuals, and clear explanations. The author has a playful, sometimes quirky style that shines through, which gives this tour a lot of personality as well as information. Very enjoyable reading - I felt like he captured all that was good about his course (and then some) and bottled it up in this book.

"This book is ideally suited to people who want a meaningful introduction into the most important contemporary concepts in Deep Learning. The book is accessible to people who lack both programming and linear algebra. Neither are needed to get a full understanding of everything the book offers.IMO, the greatest moments in the book are the asides that appear in every chapter. The author will take a paragraph to note in passing things like '... no one really knows for sure why batch normalization helps. There are various hypotheses, but no certitudes."" Or, ""Importantly, I would generally recommend placing the previous layer's activation after the batch normalization layer (although this is still a subject of debate)."" There is even an entire chapter dedicated to musings on the future of Deep Learning and general AI. This is the cherry on top that you don't get with most offers. Chollet offers them in nearly every chapter.The book may as well have been called ""Deep Learning with Keras"" and that's not a bad thing. All the code is freely downloadable and can be run for free on a Google platform. You can freely ignore the implementation details and Python and simply run and learn from the notebooks provided. NOTE: As of February 2022, the new M1 Macs have bugs in the implementation of tensorflow that prevent a few code samples from working correctly. AND, some examples take so long to run (many hours) that there may be issues running them at Google. Frustrating though it might be, it does not detract from the experience.As to cons, I don't see enough to warrant taking a star off the review. All important concepts are covered at an introductory level. The code works. The writing is clear. The author is an expert. There is a bizarre convention of having diagrams flow from the bottom to the top instead of top-down.It's a good intro and basic reference.

"I have more than 50 books on AI & ML, but Francois Chollet's bible on DL (first edition) is the only one which is open on my desk since 2018.The author decision to focus on working Python code instead of the math behind it - was crucial for its amazing success.As others have mentioned - Chollet is an excellent teacher which can explain complex and complicated ideas to the masses. I have used his code and DL techniques successfully in many projects, hackathons and Kaggle competitions.I've just received my second edition a couple of days ago - and the book is about 50% bigger than the first edition, as the author has added more examples and details plus full color printing.Strongly recommended to any aspiring data scientist.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning with Python Second Edition

"The back cover indicates ""An accessible introduction to AI ...""  Ok, it is accessible if you have a pretty good background in calculus including partial derivatives and chain rule, regression, matrix algebra operation, advanced geometry, etc.""  You get the picture.  But, that is not the author's fault.  This is the cognitive entry gate to understanding DNN.  You need a foundation going in.I have read several books on DNNs.  And, I taught myself how to develop such DNN models.  Many of the books I had read before invariably combined some contextual material with some software codes to get you going.  Although many of these books were between good and very good; it was refreshing to pick up a book solely concentrated on making you understand the underlying math of DNNs.  Be warned, the author does not let a single stone unturned.  If you are just into getting a high level understanding on how DNN work, maybe a couple of good articles at Medium will suffice.  This book is a lot more than that.  The author drills down on the subject.The author also has a pretty original approach to the subject that is much more geometry based than I had ever read elsewhere.  He talks of mapping, and different types of spaces.  He represents a lot of decisions along a two-dimensional graphs in ways I had not seen done by other authors.This book is very comparable and competitive with ""Neural Networks, a Visual Introduction for Beginners"" by Michael Taylor.  And, I think for the ones with a pretty good background in math, but below the ones of a college grad or masters in math, Taylor's book is much more accessible and actually teaches you a lot.  However, while Taylor is a very good teacher at the introductory level, Kelleher is also an excellent one at the more advanced level.  Taylor and Kelleher approach the subject differently at different levels and you will learn a lot from both.From Taylor, I got a pretty good understanding of DNNs.  And, I got to develop some pretty good DNNs to explain and simulate the stock market (with only a mediocre level of success, so I still have to keep my day job).  From Kelleher, I learned that the DNN structure I was using that included Sigmoid activation functions was really outdated.  And, that I really have to learn how to develop DNNs that use long short term memory (LSTM) with rectified linear function (ReLu) (instead of Sigmoid) to improve my DNNs.  This will be an ambitious undertaking, as I will have to graduate from using a very simple R package (deepnet) that allows you to code a DNN in essentially a single line of code with all the arguments you need to specify a traditional DNN.  But, to develop a DNN with LSTM with ReLu, I will have to use Python Keras with Tensorflow, a far more complex undertaking.  Nevertheless, Kelleher imparted to me extensive theoretical knowledge on why I have to move away from Sigmoid activation and towards ReLu with LSTM.  Given that, I could not ask more from Kelleher.  He much raised my understanding of the subject.If you are in a similar boat as I am, you will appreciate this book a lot.  As you will see, or as you know already DNNs is an ongoing process.  There is no clear finish line.  This is unlike many other model structures such as ARIMA, ECM, VAR, etc. where what you see is what you get; as these model structures have an end point.  Once you reached it, you know and understand them.  With DNNs, there is always either a topic you thought you understood, but you uncover you actually do not.  And, there are a lot of subjects you don't even know off as the field is evolving rapidly in ever complex and diversified directions.  I think DNNs will keep mathematicians busy for a pretty long time.  And, that is kind of exciting in itself.  When you uncover a quantitative method that seems to ever have room to evolve, it is pretty cool stuff.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series)
"The author has provided, in this book, a modern (to 2019) introduction to deep learning.  The focus of the book is on a limited number of topics, such as backpropagation, treated very deeply (but with few assumptions about technical preparation).  In additional, Kelleher has given a pretty up-to-date perspective on this subject.  In recent years, due to a number of factors, such as good matrix-calculation hardware, deep learning and neural networks have shot into the vanguard of interest for weak AI.  Therefore, Kelleher's expert presentation, and careful ""hand-holding"", as he proceeds to discuss some of the important topics, like the evolution of threshold functions, is particularly timely.  I think that the very minimal level of understanding of linear algebra and calculus that is necessary to grasp the technical aspects of his discussion, make this book very valuable book for a broad audience, such as for software engineers at a beginning level in this area, and technical staff generally.  Short of a good course, this summary overview is about the best one could hope for in a technical introduction, at a high level.  I strongly recommend this book as a very easy, short read, that will be informative about some important basics.  With the advent of software and hardware improvements, over the next twenty or thirty years, like quantum computers, deep learning is very likely to remain a significant tool in many technical fields, including physics (which is my primary area of interest).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series)
"I reviewed several books to get an introduction to this subject, but most of them dive into the calculus and/or code right from the start.

I think you could do very well reading this book with just a basic foundation in algebra. Calculus would be a plus, but not required.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series)

"I am surprised by how poorly written this book is. I  eagerly bought it based on all the positive reviews it had received.Bad mistake. Only a few of the reviews clearly state the obvious problems of this book. Oddly enough, these informativereviews tend to attract aggressively negative comments of an almost personal nature.The disconnect between the majority of cloyingly effusive  reviews of this book and the reality of how it is writtenis quite flabbergasting.  I do not wish to speculate on the reason for this but it does sometimes does occur witha first book  in an important area or when dealing with pioneer authors with a cult following.First of all, it is not clear who is the audience--the writing does not provide details at the level oneexpects from a textbook. It also does not provide a good overview (""big picture thinking"").  Advanced readerswould also not gain much because it is too superficial, when it comes to the  advanced topics (final 35% of book).More  than half of  this book  reads like a bibliographic notes section of a book, and the authors seemto be have no understanding of the didactic intention of a textbook (beyond a collation or importance samplingof various topics). In other words,  these portions readlike  a prose description of a bibliography, with equations thrown in for annotation. The level ofdetail is more similar to an expanded  ACM Computing Surveys article rather than a textbook inseveral chapters. At the other extreme of audience expectation, we have a review of linear algebra in the beginning,which is a waste of useful space that could have been spent on actual explanations in otherchapters.  If you don't know linear algebra already, you cannot really hope to followanything (especially in the way the book is written). In any case,  the  linearalgebra introduced in that chapter is too poorly written to even brush up on known material-- so who is that for?As a practical matter,  Part I of the book is mostly redundant/off-topic for a neural network book(containing  linear algebra, probability, and so on)and Part III is written in a superficial way--so only a third of the book is remotely useful.Other than a  chapter on optimization algorithms (good description of algorithms likeAdam), I do not see even a single chapter that has done a half-decent job of presentingalgorithms with the proper conceptual framework. The presentation style is unnecessarily terse, and dry, and is stylistically more similar to  a research paper rather than a book. It is  understood that any machine learning book would have some mathematical sophistication, but themain problem is caused by a lack of concern on part of the authors in promoting readability and an inability toput themselves in reader shoes (surprisingly enough, some defensive responses to negative reviews tend to placeblame on math-phobic readers). At the end of the day, it is the author's responsibility to makenotational and organizational choices that are likely to maximize understanding.Good mathematicians  have excellent manners while choosing notation (you don't use nestedsubscripts/superscripts/functions if you possess the clarity to do it more simply).And no, math equations  are not the same as algorithms-- only a small part of it. Where is the rest?Where is the algorithm described?  Where is the conceptual framework?Where is the intuition? Where are the pseudocodes? Where are the illustrations? Where are the examples?No, I am not asking for recipes or Python code.  Just some decent writing, details, and explanations.The sections on applications, LSTM and convolutional neural networks are hand-wavy at places and read like ""you can do this to achieve that."" It is impossible to fully reconstruct the methods from thedescription provided.A large part of the book (including  restricted Boltzmann machines)is so tightly integrated with Probabilistic Graphical models (PGM), so that it loses its neural network focus.This portion is also in the latter part of the book that is written in a rather superficial way andtherefore it implicitly creates another prerequisite of being very used to  PGM (sort-of knowing it wouldn't be enough). .Keep in mind that the PGM view of neural networks is not the dominant view today,  from either a practitioneror a research point of view. So why the focus on PGM, if they don't have the space to elaborate?On the one hand, the authors make a futile attempt at promoting accessibility by discussing redundantpre-requisites like basic linear algebra/probability basics.  On the other hand,  the  PGM-heavy approach implicitlyincreases the pre-requisites to include an even more advanced machine learning topic than neural networks(with a 1200+ page book of its own).  What the authors are doing is the  equivalent of  trying to teach someonehow to multiply two numbers as a special case of  tensor multiplication. Even for  RNNs with deterministic hidden statesthey  feel the need to couch it as a  graphical model. It is useful to connect areas, but mixing themis a bad idea.  Look at Hinton's course. It does explain the connection between Boltzmann machines and PGMvery nicely, but one can easily follow RBM without having to bear the constant burden of a PGM-centric view.One fact that I think played a role in these types of strategic  errors of judgement is the fact that thelead author is a fresh PhD graduate There is no substitute for experience when it comes to maturityin writing ability (irrespective of how good a researcher someone is).  Mature writers have the ability to putthemselves in reader shoes and have a good sense of what is conceptually important.  Theauthors clearly miss the forest from the trees, with chapter titles like ""Confrontingthe partition function.""  The book is an example of the fact that a first book in an important area with the name ofa pioneer author in it is not necessarily a qualification for being considered a good book.I am not hesitant to call it out.  The emperor has no clothes.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)
"This book is possibly currently unique in its coverage of the latest ideas in the field of deep learning -- and it is a very convenient and good survey of fundamental concepts (linear algebra, optimization, performance metrics, activation function types), different network types (multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks), practical considerations (data set, training and validation, implementation), and applications (comments on existing real-world/commercial uses).  The final 235 pages of the content portion of the book is dedicated to topics in ""Deep Learning Research"", and these topics are truly at the current frontier.Another reviewer said that one could gain the same knowledge of cutting-edge research by reading all of the latest papers (from academia and industry), but the ""research"" section of this book offers the following: Selection of the most notable research by the very experienced authors of the book, and collection of similar research in to a broader discussion of themes, and the additional insights.  The book covers very advanced and new ideas currently being explored, and it is very nice to be able to have a consistent and coherent presentation of all of those ideas.However, the book is also packed with valuable observations and pointers about more basic aspects of deep learning implementations and practices -- and such commentary is in depth and includes substantial analysis and mathematical derivation (in an intuitive presentation that often includes graphs illustrating the phenomenon).As someone with an intermediate level of knowledge and experience of neural networks, I am really grateful for this book, because seems like the ideal resource for learning cutting-edge ideas and practices, with context.  The book has excellent scope and depth, and I am confident that anyone with a solid background in linear algebra, calculus, statistics, and general machine learning, and basic neural networks (multi-layer perceptrons) will find this book to be very exciting and perhaps unique in its ability to take the reader to the next level and a new frontier.  I was personally excited to learn about the idea of representing the dependencies of intermediate quantities by directed graphs, and how this can be used to perform calculations for recurrent neural networks efficiently.  And I think the long chapter on recurrent neural networks is very helpful.Having said all of this, I think only people with significant working knowledge and experience with neural networks and mathematics -- people whose academic or professional focus has been neural networks for at least a year or two -- would benefit from this book.  This book answers a lot of the deeper questions that one is likely to have while developing a solid understanding of the fundamentals, and that's one of the book's tremendous values, but this book assumes an understanding of the fundamentals (but does briskly cover the basics).I think this book is a perfect follow-up book for the excellent book ""Neural Network Design (2nd edition)"" by Hagan, Demuth, Beale, and de Jesus, and I highly recommend the latter for gaining the solid background needed to have a thrilling experience with the ""Deep Learning"" book.In summary, I am very glad this ""Deep Learning"" book was written, and I think the ""Deep Learning"" book will be a great benefit to a lot of people, and to the evolution of the field.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)
"This is not a coding book. I see a lot of negative reviews around the expectation that this book would teach the reader how to quickly build machine learning systems and write code. This book is not for that audience.If you just want to build applications, don't worry about how deep learning works. It's akin to needing to understand how an engine works just to drive a car. If you are looking for a coding resource, try: https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=machine+learning+tensorflow&qid=1579608765&sr=8-4 . And even with that book, the material still goes far beyond what you need - use it as a light reference.I bought this book as an aspiring machine learning researcher, and towards that end, it is the best resource available in print (still true as of 2020). For instance:The first 5 chapters are timeless. These are things that were mostly established 20 or 30 years ago and beyond and are mostly STEM fundamentals at this point. There are whole textbooks dedicated to each of those chapters, but the authors provide a quick refresher and overview of probably 80% of what you'll encounter in deep learning. If you haven't previously learned each of these subtopics, you'll probably want to study them individually since they are the key to innovating (linear algebra, probability & stats, numerical computation, machine learning fundamentals).Chapters 6 thru 9 are the foundation of deep learning. We're about 12 years into seeing rapid change in the deep learning space, yet all of these principles and techniques still hold (many recent innovations are still relying on Convolutional models in 2020, which is the most layered/complex topics in those chapters). Therefore, I'd wager that these chapters are also fairly stable knowledge that is worth internalizing if you want to be deeply involved in the future of machine learning.Chapters after 9 are mostly experimental topics, and many of them are already the wrong strategies for optimal results. But there are interesting ideas in here that you'll often encounter in the wild, so it's good exposure to various topics. But probably not worth much of your time.And lastly, there is good history in here from people who know the space intimately. It's a good way to piece together the developments and learn the lexicon of deep learning so you can have intelligent conversation with experts.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)

"I ordered this book strictly because of the guy who complained about the lack of code examples, etc. The guy with the cute picture. I just picked it up in the last month.

I wound up reading things three times and sometimes going back later to read them again.I'm writing this now because the book's aging and parts of it will literally blow your mind, the first one coming in the first 20 pages or so. I just read, and perhaps I'm stretching the truth here, one of them demonstrating that the probability of a statement containing an inference holding true can be determined in a way that utterly abandons causality, a word that it's easiest not to try to explain to computers, likely.Buy this book if you want three brilliant men (with little feel for how other people's minds work, I'll concede) to explain to you what they know about a popular and likely quickly evolving field.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)

This book is an instant classic and will be THE textbook for the next generation of computer scientists investigating how computers can learn to solve problems instead of being instructed to do so.UPDATED REVIEW 4/18/2018We have conducted an intense study group of this book over the past year with people that have BA's in computer science and one whom has a PhD in computer science, so I feel like I'm in a much better place to give a real review.The Bad:> No exercises. This was our biggest problem. Without exercises, you cannot accurately judge your understanding of the text.> Hand wavy explanations. There are boundless little statements that seem to come out of nowhere and aren't explained at all.> Lack of flow. This book reads as if they worked on little sections and had no real way of putting together the topics in a cohesive exposition.> Lack of rigor. There are no proofs or rigorous exploration of results. As others have said, it reads more like a bibliography.The Good:This book has incredible sage wisdom by researches that have produced important papers in the field. I truly feel after studying this text that I have developed an intuition that could not be developed with other materials available.

"Deep Learning is an advanced book with great explanations and details. There is a heavy math focus with the book's beginning chapters detailing the necessary linear algebra and probability that one will need to understand deep learning. I liked that the author's chose to cover only the parts of these subjects which are relevant to deep learning.There are many interesting philosophical sections in the book as well. Just about when I was feeling overwhelmed with the complexity of the mathematics the authors take a step back and cover the foundations of deep learning such as borrowing concepts from human learning. There was an interesting dicussion about the early studies done on the vision of cat's and monkey's in the 1970s.The text covers the entire history of deep learning and the bibliography is hundreds of sources. It is clear this is the most comprehensive text available about deep learning. For anybody interested in this topic this book is a mandatory read.There are sections about machine learning as well, which makes sense because deep learning is a subset of machine learning. These sections focused on the machine learning concepts which are most relevant to deep learning.The book was well organized and divided into three parts which cover mathematics related to deep learning, typical deep learning techniques, and then more experiment learning techniques. Often the author's state when a technique works well or when it does not, and which types of data works best for the technique.Just a warning, the math in this book is highly complex.

"Reading 'Deep Learning Illustrated' was a fantastic journey into the world of deep learning. The book is divided into two main parts which, depending on your goal and background, can be studied exclusively. The first part is a great comprehensive journey through the history of deep learning. This is especially valuable since many ML practitioners learn the code without a proper understanding of how and why it all started, which, in my opinion, is essential to a good comprehension of any scientific breakthrough. The second part focuses on the code which is complemented by a Github repository. This is a tougher part of the book since deep learning is a bit like rocket science, but the authors try to make it as easy as possible by using relatively simple language and explaining every chunk of code without overdoing the math part so you can quickly immerse yourself in the world of neural networks and start working on your own examples.

"Poorly written, haphazardly organized, book.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning Architectures: A Mathematical Approach (Springer Series in the Data Sciences)
"This book is well-written and comprehensive. Its coverage of optimization for neural network learning is the best in any book so far. The part on information geometry is superb too. However, the „Analytic Theory“ part is disappointing: It reflects the classical results (on shallow(!) neural network approximation theory!) quite nicely, but lately there has been a lot of activity in harmonic analysis, using e.g. wavelet to understand the expressiveness of deep neural networks. Maybe it’s still a bit too early to present positive results in a book, but I personally find this matter quite confusing and it would have been nice to have at least a survey of „common wisdom“ and a (qualitative) discussion of current research revolving around the question why deep neural networks outperform shallow networks and when/why/in what sense they apparently can break the curse of dimensionality. That’s why I give only 4 and not 5 stars.( BTW: G. Kutyniok and P. Grohs are writing a book „Deep Learning Theory,“ which is about to appear in Cambridge University Press soon; those are two leading researchers, I have very high hopes for the book to close this gap on analytic theory )I personally like the somewhat large font (and therefore short lines) in the book, which makes it pleasant to read, but others may disagree.Needless to say, this is not a book for the average computer science graduate student. It’s a book for readers with curiosity who bring the necessary mathematical maturity.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning Architectures: A Mathematical Approach (Springer Series in the Data Sciences)
"This is not a traditional deep learning book. Covers very unique theoretical topics of deep learning, viz. universal approximators, exact learning, information capacity assessment, neuromanifold.

"Overall, the book is decent.  The writing is clear and the amount of information on each technique is good - just detailed enough that you can understand it, without excessive detail.  It also covers a nice selection of topics.  The selection of methods should leave the reader in a good place to learn the more advanced stuff on their own.However, the authors make the same mistake countless other instructors make - with the exception of a single, self-contained example for REINFORCE, all the examples in the book make use of their own personal framework (the SLM lab).  This is done in an effort to reduce boilerplate, but it means the examples are no longer self-contained and it adds the additional burden of learning their framework, which I'm entirely uninterested in doing because in practice I will use my own.  Ideally, all the examples would be pure PyTorch, and each should entirely self-contained in a single file so you can run the example as is, without learning a new framework or having to reference other modules.  Obviously nobody would write production code this way, but for pedagogic purposes, this is by far the easiest way to learn.  Note to instructors everywhere: we're not interested in your framework, no matter how proud of it you are.  It doesn't belong in an instructional text.Otherwise, it's a very good book and despite my complaint, I would recommend it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Practice in Python (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)
"An invaluable guide to deep RL. As many reviews have pointed out, the use of SLM-Lab is quite flawed, but that doesn't take away from the value of the book itself.

This book along with Sutton’s book makes for a perfect entry into the field of RL/DRL.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Practice in Python (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)
DRL is a relatively new field.  Especially versions like double DQN and the like.  It is hard to find a book that does not pander to the reader and just throw Python code at you.  This book is excellent!  It formally defines all RL and DRL terms and gets into and presents algorithmic details of DQN and double DQN which are only found in papers.

"The authors have taken great pains to keep the book relevant to the times. The fact that a companion git repo is available to try out what you’re reading about in each chapter shows the Theory and Practice approach they describe.

"This book offers an educational plan to provide an improved education environment.  This is a follow-up to a previous book that laid out the framework for the deep learning concept (circa 2015).  Although the original underlying ideas and research dated back almost 15 years ago.  So, the books came in the marketing stage of exposition and provides some practical tools that teachers and educators can use.  So, if I haven't said so already (and I haven't) the target audience for this book are teachers and principals.  Of course, a parent could pick the book up and try and develop a home environment to compliment the tools in the book, but that would be very complimentary.  Home school is an entirely different question, but based on the book, some items may apply and others depend on group activities.  How children learn from other children is a hot topic debated between home schoolers and almost everyone else.This is a decent book, but already there are other standards instituted by the states and US government that are different (but have some very high similarities).  But it is different and it was what the schools are generally using.  So, really there is a big part of the book that is trying to grow this idea in the educational community.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Dive Into Deep Learning: Tools for Engagement
"I didn’t know what to expect when I ordered this, this is a follow up book to Deep Learning: Engage the World Change the World published in 2018 which introduces the concept. This is a thorough guide to changing the method of instruction from what schooling has been known as. Being a public school teacher in the classroom, this is not something that I can just implement myself, this is a philosophical shift and this is something that has to be supported by the entire public school amd administration and district as it entails different lesson planning, materials, different assessments, grading policies and use of different rubrics. This is a large book and at 280 pages it provides a lot of information, charts, pages to be filled by the reader. This is intended to be a roadmap to shift the method of instruction from the old to this new vision. It is complex. I applaud the intention.

"As an educational psychologist, I am always interested in resources that present fresh ideas for learning and engagement.  And this book presents a nice exploration of this topic. While the book does not focus on a specific age group, it is focused on K-12 learners.  I teach adult learners in higher education and I found many parts of the book relevant to my work.  The authors take a very holistic, whole child approach to the learning process, and provide an excellent overview of what deep learning is with this viewpoint.  The authors focus on competency-driven approaches with strategies for the students to engage with learning on a deeper level.  It is a nice summary of the research that is out there, and is very evidence-driven and does a great job addressing the motivation of learners who engage in these strategies (it definitely helps).  My only criticism is that the book doesn't address some of the potential negatives of deep learning strategies, namely student time management issues, which is what often happens with adult learners.

"This is mostly a good introductory book. Especially useful since there is a bit of a dearth on Tensorflow 2.x books out there.  One thing I was interested in and was how to import keras and bring in datasets.  So far I have gotten most of the way through Chapter 1.  Disturbingly, on the IMDB example there are errors in the code.  It can be fairly straightforward to fix them.  One was in the statements to import the IMDB database.  It is like the author thought of implementing the code one way, changed their mind and didn't check it out.  I assume this happens later in the book too.  I have coded a fair amount in tensorflow1.x and have been looking for a good book on tensorflow2.x.  So here I am.  I wanted one that also explored how keras was integrated into tensorflow.  I know there is a script to convert files but I was worried the process would not be overly transparent, so I wanted to type in the examples myself.  So far I am glad I went this route.  Tensorflow2.x seems a vast improvement and is much easier to follow and this is evident in the code examples I have read and implemented so far in chapter 1.  I don't mind so errors, just not too many.  I think of correcting them as a form of homework.Since I am using it to self study and get up to speed on Tensorflow2.x I am happy so far.

"I was new to machine learning when I tried to read this textbook. I think it would be better suited for someone who has already been studying machine learning for a while. I have a lot of python experience though, so that made things a little easier. I like that it tries to cover a ton of different things. The best thing about this book is that it covers a wide range of topics. But I feel like each topic in the book is explained very quickly. I had a lot of questions about each topic and had to Google a lot of stuff while reading it. It wasn't always clear why they were adding the layers that they were adding to the model. Or what the advantages and disadvantages of doing it that way was. If this book was a class, I probably wouldn't do so well on the final. Maybe someday I will get good enough at machine learning to be able to help the authors edit and improve the book.

"The book is well written, i.e. very readable, explaining what is going on very well.  As a tool for learning about Neural Networks it is good.  Where it all falls apart is the instructions (or lack thereof) for running any of the examples of which there are many.  The idea behind Tensorflow.js is terrific, i.e. use Javascript/your browser/node.js.  The issue is the book glosses over installation of Tensorflow.js and after hours and hours of trying to install any version (and all its dependencies) that works with Chome, Edge, and/or a version of Node.js all you get is error after error after error...

I would say this is a great book to kickstart a career in a modern ML / Computer Vision domain. Compared to Goodfellow, it's way more practical in terms of what you need to know to actually build a good a model from scratch. It doesn't go into a deep math background. It doesn't cover 101 research branches that were undertaken in last 20 years but ended up not working in a field. It solely focuses on what exactly is being used in industry these days.On the cons side, I think, to be a good CV engineer there should be a pre-requisite to this book: a more classic computer vision course.

"This book is an ideal mix of theory (math behind RL) and practice (practical issues/challenges; code). The book is structured in a logical manner - starts simple, and each (non-task-specific) chapter essentially builds on the prior ones. Essentially - ""We just covered tabular learning - but what if the state space is so large that tabular learning becomes computationally infeasible? Let's use Deep Q Networks"" or ""We just covered DQN in the last chapter - but what are some issues with DQNs and what can we do to improve them?""One benefit to the structure of the book is that there are essentially 3 levels of depth for each chapter - you can read the summary at the beginning to get the main idea, you can read the theory portions to actually understand the math, and you can go through the code if you want to understand it at the deepest level.The theory explanations are great - just enough math that you can feel confident about the mathematical foundations, but not so much that you get lost in the (unnecessary) weeds.

"I should start out by saying I'm only about 25% through the book, and it's taken me almost two months to get this far. The reason being, I've re-read the first 200 or so pages over three times, taking my time to understand the concepts, taking lots of notes, and running the hands-on programs over and over. But I have every confidence that whenever I do finish this--and it could be a year or more--I'll have an incredibly wide breadth of knowledge in DRL. As I said in my headline, it's a challenge and--for me at least--is requiring a lot of mental effort.

"I was invited by the publisher to review this book and provide my thoughts on that. Overall, I found the book to be very informative and well laid out. It takes you through the very basics of backpropagation to advanced implementations in PyTorch. The book assumes that the reader does have an understanding of Python at the very least, which I think beginners in deep learning should be aware of. Please find my honest thoughts on the book as follows:What I liked:I felt the book is very well structured and compiled. Unless you're looking for something very very specific, you'd be able to find techniques/implementations for any and all types of problems you are working on. They cover algorithms and implementations of basic neural networks, all the way upto RNNs and reinforcement learning with PyTorch. The breadth covered by this book on the number of techniques and algorithms is really amazing. Not only that, each of these topics are covered with amazing depth as well, making the book a must have for someone just starting out with PyTorch. The progression in difficulty of the book, also makes it beginner friendly.What I would like to be there:I would love to see 2 things added to this book:1. Tensorboard setup with PyTorch, and usage. Although it's trivial, it would take some getting used to in setting up tensorboard with PyTorch. It's fairly common to use a graphical visualization tool like this while training and tracking your models. A small chapter, or a section in the appendix on how to setup tensorboard with PyTorch, and some examples to integrate that into your pipeline, would really be amazingly beneficial for any beginner/ intermediate user!2. PyTorch models can't generally be used directly in the industry because most embedded chips don't have compilers for .pth models. Most chip manufacturers (unless you're using nvidia GPUs itself), have compilers implemented for either tensorflow, caffe models or the cross compatible ONNX format. I think a small section on converting your models into ONNX would really be beneficial for anyone just starting out and targeting embedded/high performance applications on the edgeAll in all, I loved and enjoyed reading the book. It is a definite recommendation from my side for anyone who is starting out with PyTorch, or someone looking to implement advanced algorithms (more than just the basic feedforward networks or CNNs). Amazing work by Ayyadevara and Reddy! :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Modern Computer Vision with PyTorch: Explore deep learning concepts and implement over 50 real-world image applications
"I have been invited to write a review for this book, I have generally reviewed, I found this is a very good book if you are a beginner or interested in the deep learning field with using python. Most of this book introduced experiments or code snippets based on Pytorch which is a very popular deep learning library in academic research and industries. This book can equip you with an overview of the necessary knowledge along with practical implementations, after reading this book, it expects that at least you could solve basic problems or even harder ones in your tasks and you would feel be comfortable acquiring new knowledge in a fast way.Enjoy reading!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Modern Computer Vision with PyTorch: Explore deep learning concepts and implement over 50 real-world image applications
"Ayyadevara and Reddy’s 'Modern Computer Vision with PyTorch' is a well constructed beginner to intermediate level text on working more efficiently and creatively with PyTorch in image analysis and CV techniques.  The chapters are well laid out in a logical progression from neural network and PyTorch fundamentals to more advanced topics in neural network design and model implementation. In addition to the theory behind the concepts, the authors include numerous and easy to follow examples, and make all code available via Github. This practical, hands-on approach allows readers to more easily grasp complex ideas and techniques. Supported by the innovative industry experience of both authors, the inclusion of a chapter on moving a model to production, a topic often overlooked, will be highly useful to the budding data scientist.

"This textbook is for the serious life-long learners of machine learning. There are at least two ways to ‘consume’ this book.For the expert in ML, this is a textbook to study as a clear comprehensive ML overview and then to dive into sections of interest or ignorance. The concepts are grounded in code examples and are well cited (with links) to sources. Further, this textbook is appropriate if you are TensorFlow-centric and want to broaden into cutting-edge ML models/tools coded in PyTorch.For a new learner to ML, this is a textbook to DO (not just READ) with hands-on and brain-engaged. If you realize that ML is a key life-long skill for your career, consider this textbook as part of a daily learning habit (10-30 min).From personal experience, my advice to the new learner is as follows… First, clone the GitHub repository, setup your Python environment, and study the textbook, while working through the notebooks. Go on tangents and break the code. Do this methodically as part of your daily learning habit, but do not hesitate to jump ahead several chapters to prepare for tomorrow’s meeting. There is enough excellent material here for a full year of ML adventures.I did a similar strategy with Raschka’s first textbook. About four years ago, I had finished Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization as a student in his first cohort. I knew the concepts well but could not do the actual application coding. I was surprised how my Python coding improved by following Raschka’s clean and elegant style. And Raschka’s code examples were meaty enough to be springboards into working applications.Several textbook editions later, what is different about this new edition?First, it moves you through scikit-Learn (a firm foundation) to PyTorch, instead of TensorFlow. PyTorch is a better stepping-stone, both conceptually and practically. With PyTorch, you will go further with less energy, while being able to convert your efforts into TensorFlow as needed. In addition, most of the cutting-edge ML/AI/DL research is in PyTorch. It is nice to read a recent arXiv paper, clone their repository, click on the  Colab tutorial, and replicate their experiments, along with picking up a ton of new coding tricks & tips. I am excited to work through these PyTorch sections to hone my skills.Second, there is a clear recognition of model tracking and tuning practices. This is often a gap in other ML textbooks and courses. Once you progress beyond the simple demo examples in a lecture, you realize that the real work is experiments, more experiments, and still more experiments, so that you must understand what the model architecture and hyperparameters are doing to your dataset. There is good coverage of scikit-Learn pipeline, grid search, model performance, and the like.Third, ML/AI/DL practice is rapidly evolving. Every week new ML packages/services become available that could save much grief on your current project. What is refreshing about Raschka’s textbook series is that he constantly adding cutting-edge topics because he likes to stay current and to help us stay current. Hence, this edition contains recent ML treats as: transformers, self-supervised learning, autoencoders-to-GAN, graph neural networks, DBSCAN, t-SNE (with brief mention of UMAP), and PyTorch-Lightning.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn: Develop machine learning and deep learning models with Python

"Machine Learning can often be intimidating whether you are starting out or already a practitioner. It is easy to get stuck on one concept, walk away frustrated, or just copy that code you find on StackOverflow without really understanding what it does. What the authors of this book, Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn, have managed to do is to keep the reader engaged giving a deeper illustration as to how the concepts work. In this book, you get practical code examples, a detailed explanation of how the various library tools work, and exposure to the mathematical concepts behind machine learning algorithms. In addition, what I like about the book unlike many machine learning books is that the authors have managed to intuitively explain how each algorithm works, how to use them, and the mistake you need to avoid.I have not read a Machine Learning book that better explains Transformers as this one does. The authors have managed to give a detailed dive into this model architecture through well-explained codes and illustrations. As a reader, you walk away having intuitively grasped the concepts of attention and self-attention in ways that will make this crucial NLP architecture clear. You get exposed to pre-trained models from HuggingFace library which really helps to have that hands-on experience working with large datasets.As they have done throughout the book, the authors have broken down those complex mathematical operations into simple explanations that are easy to follow. What I generally like about the book is how it seamlessly connects all the chapters, not throwing off the reader. There are numerous external resources quoted throughout the book. This helps spark that curiosity to dig deeper. In addition, you get introduced to PyTorch, getting exposed to all those sophisticated libraries that help the reader learn how to maximize their compute power. I would say it is not intimidating at all even if you have not used PyTorch before.I would recommend this book to anybody seeking a textbook that is both easy to read and modern in its content. If were to rate the book I will give it a 10/10 as it really applies to both beginners and experienced practitioners, covers all the concepts one needs to apply in their operations, and acts as a quick reference.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn: Develop machine learning and deep learning models with Python
"BLUF: A thorough primer for machine learning enthusiasts with plenty of theory to underscore its many practical examples. A definite must-have for anyone looking to add PyTorch to their machine learning tool belt.PROS:- Extremely thorough (if not comprehensive). I really appreciate that this book doesn't just thrust one into building models with PyTorch. It starts at the ""beginning"" and provides examples, theory, additional resources, and citations along the way.- Theory. Those whose calculus and linear algebra courses ended many years ago will appreciate (if not remember exactly) the mathematical theory and notation that accompanies almost every paragraph. This book gives one the opportunity to ""dig deeper"" or stay in the shallows until the notation stops.- Python. Rather than simply utilizing Scikit-Learn to illustrate concepts and introduce models, this book contains many sections where models (such as a Perceptron) are coded from the ground up so the reader can fully understand the underlying mechanics. Python enthusiasts will nerd out. Parents of small children might want to skip a few pages.- Graphs, charts, and graphics. There are plenty of places where a drier text might have foregone the use of graphs. This text does not. It does however refrain from overusing them.- PyTorch. This should be obvious from the title, but this text prioritizes PyTorch instead of TensorFlow. This is especially helpful for those looking for an alternative to Keras and TensorFlow as the PyTorch API is very user-friendly.CONS:- Almost too much code. This isn't a true ""con"" but anyone wanting to emulate or follow along with the examples would do well to get the digital edition so they can copy and paste.- Length and complexity. Anyone hoping for a ""quick read"" or a ""quick start guide"" will be disappointed. This book hovers somewhere between an undergraduate primer and a graduate-level text for length and readability. This is not to say that it's difficult to read, merely that there are other ""quick start"" / ""practical"" texts out there that cater more to a lay audience.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn: Develop machine learning and deep learning models with Python
"I found a very interesting book and picked it up as quickly as I could.  It's a complete guide to machine learning that focuses on PyTorch rather than TensorFlow.  I greatly appreciate that this book exists as it gives developers a choice of which library to learn about.This is a great book for anyone wanting to get into machine learning as well as someone changing careers.  I highly encourage both to check out this book.While the book isn't split up into sections, the divisions are clear.  The first ten chapters discuss the fundamentals of machine learning, everything from basic definitions to cleaning data to a few projects.  I always encourage people to do the projects and share them as a portfolio; this book makes it easier to do so.Chapter 11 looks at a general neural network before moving on to using PyTorch in chapters 12 and 13.  The remaining chapters use PyTorch to build projects that give the reader a wide variety of experience.For the first time in any technical book that I've yet seen, the final section of the final chapter includes a book summary to help reinforce what the reader has learned.  I appreciate this and hope more authors include this in the future.This really is a good book.

"Note: I received an advanced copy from the publisher, but I have read Sebastian Raschka's previous machine learning book and am familiar with his work.  Off the top of my head the most comparable previous work is Aurélien Géron's ""Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow"".  Both books have a similar format; the first half is a general introduction to machine learning principles and ""non-Deep Learning"" machine learning models, while the second half is dedicated to Deep Learning with a modern framework, though Raschka's book packs out at a whopping 800 pages.For the past few years Geron's book is a frequently recommended ""first book"" for people who are technically proficient but new to machine learning, for its all encompassing nature. How do these two books compare? First, Raschka's professor background shows; while Geron's book is a more friendly introduction, Raschka's book makes sure to explain all of the fundamentals.  As an academic myself I really like this, and urge anyone new to ML working through this book to really understand the fundamentals when coding; it will help with ML engineering and research, and with helping to stay afloat in a fast moving field.Second, ML is a fast changing field, and a lot has happened since Geron's book was published in 2017.  Although the 2019 2nd edition is a timely update, we've been seeing PyTorch eclipse Tensorflow in popularity especially in ML research.  We've also seen the PyTorch ecosystem grow and become more involved, and Raschka's book makes sure to talk about the various PyTorch features.In addition, the field of Deep Learning has changed a lot.  In the past four years image classification has ceased to be a hard topic for DL, transformers have massively changed the landscape, and fields like GANs, Graph neural networks, and Reinforcement learning has ceased to be esoteric academic topics and are all seeing applications in industry, and a strength of Raschka's book is addressing all of these.Finally, some advice for people who are reading through this book and getting up to speed with Deep Learning: read and work through the code examples.  Many books about Machine Learning skimp over the programming aspects and/or guide the reader to call libraries, and as a result users are frustrated when it comes time to implement and use models.  Don't neglect the coding aspects of getting ML models up and running. A strength of Raschka's book are the code examples, which walk through how to implement the models. His codes for PyTorch resemble what is used in production, and are generally high quality.Finally, if you've made it through this book, congrats! Go and use what you've learned for some fun projects, and also pair it with a good book or resource on deploying and monitoring your ML models.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn: Develop machine learning and deep learning models with Python
"The authors are definitely ambitious: >300 pages jam packed with content. I like how all the authors are out there working in industry - that gives this work credibility (and kudos for sharing a PDF with all the figures and charts). This book hits the right spot with a huge push for MLOps but very few resources to learn about it; great how 5 of the 13 chapters (38%) deal with deployment. A bit surprising so little time (only two chapters) deal with data preparation, but at least one of those is the useful Data Preparation in the Cloud. The problem with such a large book is that it can feel exhausting wading through it all. At times it feels more like a reference book rather than a teaching textbook. In my opinion this book is targeted to people already in the deep learning space and not those with ""beginner-level knowledge in machine learning or software engineering"" as the preface claims. It is definitely not the book for you as an entry point into the deep learning.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Production-Ready Applied Deep Learning: Learn how to construct and deploy complex models in PyTorch and TensorFlow deep learning frameworks
"This is a wonderful and rather unique book on deep learning (DL) in production. In contrast to most available books on machine learning (ML) that cover mostly theory and/or model training, this book focuses on real-world aspects of model deployment and DL pipelines in production. It covers a variety of important (and often neglected) topics, including data preparation, model management and experiment tracking (with W&B and DVC), as well as production-related topics such as model deployment and monitoring in cloud (AWS) and mobile (iOS and Android) environments. Deep learning frameworks covered include both PyTorch and TensorFlow.I can imagine two main audiences that will benefit the most from this book: software engineers that will learn how to apply their knowledge to build AI-focused applications, and machine learning practitioners and data scientists that will learn what it takes to productionize their models and turn them into customer-facing applications.While this book should probably not be your first experience with DL, if you already have some knowledge on DL or are a software engineer focusing on DL in production, this book will take your knowledge to the next level and make you a better DL practitioner, well-versed in the different aspects of DL in production.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Production-Ready Applied Deep Learning: Learn how to construct and deploy complex models in PyTorch and TensorFlow deep learning frameworks

Part 3, deployment and maintenance, helps beginners to get an overall idea of Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and Elastic Kubernetes Services. However, certain sections of the chapter could have been better. For example, chapter 11, Deep Learning on Mobile Devices, doesn't explain the detailed steps to deploy the model on iOS and Android apps.

The accompanying code base is incredibly coherent and easy to follow. A strong recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning
"I had trouble picturing how the Grokking series would be able to cover such a complex topic as deep reinforcement learning.  I came to this book with prior exposure to Reinforcement Learning and a short prior exposure to Deep Reinforcement Learning.  So while I can’t quite give the perspective of a complete novice, the book did strike me as being very well organized and explained.  What really sets this book apart is the annotation of both math formulas and Python code.One helpful feature of the book was the “Refresh My Memory” sections.  In them, the author summarizes relevant concepts presented in earlier chapters just in time to apply them to the new material of the current chapter.  This saves the reader from flipping backward to search for the prior references.  I found these sections to be completely sufficient to keep moving forward and absorb the new material.  I also like that the author explains not just how the algorithms work, but why they work, and presents plots that compare the performance of different algorithms.The code and Docker instructions on the author’s github repo were very easy to follow (I already had Docker installed).  Since I had previous experience with RL, I have not run all of the code, but I did run the code for the more advanced algorithms in chapters 9, 10, and 12.  The code itself is well written and clean.  The notebooks in early chapters have plenty of comments to help understand what is happening.I caught almost no typos, which surprised me for a first edition of a sizable book.  The writing style is conversational, which helps make a technical subject much less dry.In summary, if someone were to ask me to recommend one book to take them from a novice to a capable deep reinforcement learning practitioner, I would recommend this one.  I would recommend that a reader actively engage with the provided code.  Add doc strings and comments to the code as you read it.  Then try to rewrite the algorithms yourself from just the math and explanations, or translate the PyTorch portions to TensorFlow to really test your understanding.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning
"I've read a few books on Reinforcement Learning, and this is the best introduction I've encountered. This is not a project based book, it teaches pure understanding in a usable form. I was able to implement these algorithms myself without referring to the code in the book. Afterwards, for the sake of comparison, I downloaded the code associated with the book and found it all worked flawlessly. If you just want the understanding, without the distraction of projects, this book is good. Or, if you want some projects to play with, the associated notebooks give you that as well.The book is filled with diagrams and other interesting tidbits. You could skip these, but I find they fit well into the flow of the book. This makes it easy to move through the book with different levels of detail. If you read only the main text the book is quick and succinct. Or, if you just idly flip through the pages, you'll find interesting and informative diagrams you can learn from 30-seconds at a time. All these diagrams and side notes also serve to help you remember where you are in the text, making it easy to visually recognize the material you've already read.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning
"The author presents the topic with a level of enthusiasm unparalleled in other subject literature.  I've only read through the first half of the book and have found it can be read like a narrative where one section builds on the previous, I can see myself using this as reference material as well.If you are interested in Reinforcement Learning, or building intelligent agents using software this book is definitely worth your time.

"This book was written very poorly and informally. Most of it is very unclear. Also, mathematical symbols are used throughout the book so you constantly have to remember where they were defined and look back for their meanings. A ""Grokking"" title should be much more clear. It seems this book was translated from another language, or had little to no editing.Take as one example on page 133 at the bottom:""Sure, we want high returns, but high in expectation (on average)""Firstly I dont think this sentence is grammatically correct. Is this saying we want the expectation of returns to be high? If so, the returns and the expectation of returns are two different things, so the sentence is very unclear. A clearer way to state this would have been ""Sure we want high returns, but we want the expectations of the returns to be high even more so."" (still pretty unclear, probably should be split or rephrased).The next sentence that follows is""If the agent is in a noisy environment, or if the agent is using a stochastic policy, it's all fine.""Once again I don't think that sentence is grammatically correct. What is all fine? What does it mean to be all fine? There are no clues presented in the context of the paragraph.The sentence that follows is also confusing:""The agent is trying to maximize the expected total discounted reward, after all: value functions.""What does ""after all: value functions"" mean? The first part of the sentence makes sense. I don't know if this was translated from a different language. ""after all: noun"" isn't a phrase I am familiar with in the English language.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning
"I bought this book to get up to speed with the main problems in Biology and see where I could contribute as an ML engineer. Given how big the scope is, each chapter maps to an entire field it's challenging to finish this book and feel like you're a domain expert in all of them.No book, especially one this short will give you that deep of an understanding on that wide of a topic. However, seeing the DeepChem code examples taught me more about Chemistry than perhaps my entire high school education.The only reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because the quality of the book degrades near the end and sort of becomes a cookbook for random ML techniques like using GANs for drug discovery.

Terrific book for folks looking to understand the basics of machine learning and handful of applications across life sciences. The book takes a really thoughtful step-by-step approach and also gives the opportunity to run the code to get a real understanding of the technology. I’m not a programmer so even skipping those examples I learned a ton about ML and broad range of use cases in the life sciences from tox and binding predictions to microscopy and imagine analysis to electronic medical records.

"This is a really nice introduction to a variety of health science applications.  I was particularly interested in the drug discovery chapter.  The discussion touches on some of the key challenges for preparing the molecule data for deep learning, such as featurization.  For example,""Unfortunately, the behaviors of biophysical systems are critically constrained by their 3D structures, so the 2D techniques from previous chapters miss crucial information.  As a result, we will discuss a pair of new featurization techniques in this chapter.  The first featurization technique, the grid featurization, explicitly searches a 3D structure for the presence of critical physical interactions such as hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (more on these later), which are known to play an important role in determining protein structure.  The advantage of this technique is that we can rely upon a wealth of known facts about protein physics.  The weakness, of course, is that we are bound by known physics and lessen the chance that our algorithm will be able to detect new physics.""""The alernative featurization technique is the atomic featurization, which simply provides a processed representation of the 3D positions and identities of all atoms in the system.  This makes the challenge for the learning algorithm considerably harder, since it must learn to identify critical physical interactions, but it also makes it feasible for learning algorithms to detect new patterns of interesting behavior.""Similar to the paragraphs above, most of the book is pretty high level, with a few tips & tricks and code examples sprinkled in.  So this book is best for someone who would like a brief introduction (the whole book is a quick read, can be finished in one evening) before getting into other books and web resources that cover the topic in depth.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for the Life Sciences: Applying Deep Learning to Genomics Microscopy Drug Discovery and More
"I received Deep Learning specifically to write a review.  That said, I try to be honest and open in all my reviews.(Please see the enclosed pictures.)I loved the level of detail in the book.  It showed the deep learning code as well as demonstrated where to find data for learning and training systems.The book took just the right level of technical depth both to be credible as well as remain interesting and allow the reader to engage in learning.You can see from the table of contents just how much information is packed into this small book.My one caveat is that much of the book revolves around using the DeepChem program that is only available for Mac and Linux users.Chapter two alone is worth four stars as it is a detailed, but approachable description of deep learning.If you are a Mac or Linux user then the review jumps to five stars.As a Windows user, you are going to struggle a bit and have to imagine what the code might have done had you run it.All in all, read this as a primer on life sciences and how they relate to potential deep learning applications.If you are a Mac or Linux user then go beyond the basics and learn how to do some basic deep learning programming.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for the Life Sciences: Applying Deep Learning to Genomics Microscopy Drug Discovery and More

"Considering that the audience for this book is very limited, the authors assume a fair amount of background information on the key scientific approaches/hypotheses that drive various stages of life science projects, particularly those on drug discovery.  Of course, not all stages, are amenable to or can rely on ML techniques, so one should expect some gaps in treatment in this book.  For a technical overview of the process and step-by-step exploration, the use of an example throughout the book is very helpful, though one may not be able to draw parallels to one's own project.  You will need to look at the sample projects at DeepChem dot io;  If your intent is to get an overview of ML techniques, there are much better books from the same publisher that you can depend on - this is not an intro to ML, this is an intro to a highly specialized set of topics.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for the Life Sciences: Applying Deep Learning to Genomics Microscopy Drug Discovery and More

"I'll be upfront and admit that I don't work in the health sciences field. I grabbed this book because like many people in the data science field, I aim to be as well-rounded as possible.And much of the material was pretty decent. There was a lot of depth, with many examples (including sample code, which I wasn't always able to get to work), and instructions for finding sample data sets. I was able to understand the material without difficulty, and the examples were presented in a way that everything became obvious once you understood it. Overall, it was well-written.But as someone who doesn't work at a university, I don't normally use a Mac. I do use Linux, but on a Raspberry Pi, or off of a portable drive, mostly for my own personal tinkering, and so the heavy reliance on the Deep Chem library (which is not available for Windows) was a frequent source of frustration.Maybe you're exactly the target audience, and then I'm sure you'll be very happy with this book.

"I've skimmed the entire book and have worked through several chapters in detail. My first reaction is this book covers about 3-4 years of undergraduate math with some graduate school math topics.My CS degree is 30+ years old, but my daughter just finished her CS/Math degree and the undergraduate math requirements have changed very little. My old-school CS degree covered only about 80% of the topics in this book.If you've taken these classes then this is book provides an awesome review put in the perspective of how to use python to help with these problems. If you haven't taken at least statistics, calculus, and linear algebra, you may find that you need books that introduce these topics in a more beginner-friendly way. And then use this book to provide ML context to the math. There are many good intro books and youtube videos that can help start with these topics. An example of a beginner-friendly statistics book might be ""The Cartoon Guide to Statistics"" which is fantastic. Good videos would be anything by 3blue1brown.I'm reading the Kindle version of the book. The formatting seems quite good for a Kindle book. Kudos to the author for not treating Kindle as an afterthought.I'm finding this to be a very useful book. The title did warn that it's a mathy book.

"I thank the authors for writing this important work. They gave formal mathematical explanation of why we tune hyper-parameters during training ( so that criticality =1, to avoid the model blowing up or shrinking to nothing), the rationale of “deep” and the optimization of model depth, what exactly is learning, why use gradient descent instead of Bayesian approach, how residual network and Transformer designs help capture information, how model extracts information that can generalize and strip away irrelevant details.  AI rituals that were passed down from the tribal elders finally have a rational basis.Even though the math can get pretty heavy (based on Einstein’s General Relativity and Quantum mechanics, with a touch of group theory), the authors did provide the basic background to help the readers reach that level of math: kind of like 1 +1= 2, therefore a + a = 2a, therefore Heisenberg equation is self-evident.  For non-math people like me, the authors helpfully translated their math into English.I really enjoy their humor too:  As shown in the example provided, one formula can fit the whole page.  The authors called this Formula the “T Shirt Formula” (named in the index) because it can be fit into a T shirt. “To raise brand awareness”, a helpful footnote was provided, which stated that “ with the trained NTK you can now fit the finite-width prediction formula (∞.155) on any newborn AI’s onesie. “",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Principles of Deep Learning Theory: An Effective Theory Approach to Understanding Neural Networks

I was hoping to find in this book a resource that provided practical advice for making this so, but it didn't fulfill my expectations. The authors identify six core compentencies that must be fostered to deepen learning, all of which are great. The book, however, iss strong on theory but vague on implementation. The language of the authors at times borders on gobbledygook rather than the clear expression that I would expect from advocates of deep learning. They also invest a level of faith in digital technologies that is unwarranted. I am in a digital technologies professional with 35 years of experience.

The field of deep learning is really vast and Chollet covers an impressive amount in this book mostly at a relatively high/applied level, which I think is a good thing.

"If the paperback book I received didn't look and feel like an illegal physical copy or a rather poor quality physical product, I'd be giving it 5 stars, so 3 stars here is for the crappy production quality and not for the content.  I borrowed this paperback book from our public library and really liked it.  The content is great, and it's a useful tool to get up and started with machine learning -- IF -- you already know how to write code in Python.  If you aren't at least familiar with some Python and you aren't going to bother making an effort to learn more, then get a different book.  Good luck finding one as good.Since I really liked the copy I borrowed from the library, and prefer paper books to eBooks (I'm old -- MSDOS old), I decided to get a (paper) copy and saw a good price from an Amazon re-seller.  But what I got differed physically quite a bit from the copy I'd borrowed from the library.  When I first received the paperback book from a 3rd party vendor, it seemed ""off"", as if it weren't new or even like new.  The cover had some wrinkling near the binding and the book is warped a bit, as if it was stored in a humid environment.  It's not warped in a way that makes it unusable, just in that way that gives the entire book a slight curl near the edges.  Furthermore, the binding seems ""stiff"" compared to other Manning Publications products; but this can happen if too much glue is used in the binding during fabrication process.  Then, as I flipped through the pages, a lot of them look like they were photocopied (!!!) as opposed to printed, especially with respect to the images.  The difference between what I received and the much higher quality book I'd borrowed from the library was dramatic in this regard.  I had a panic moment thinking I had purchased a well-done ""fake"" or illegal copy of the physical book (which might still be true).  Manning Publications let's you get a free eBook copy of many of their books, so I went through the steps and was able to register and get my eBook without any problems, so maybe the copy is legit after all.  If not, maybe I registered prior to the owner of the original?  I have no idea.  Since my purchase was through a 3rd party on Amazon and not Amazon directly, the eBook process worked, and it was inexpensive, I'm not going to waste more of my life beyond this review going through the hassle of trying to return it, since the content IS really good, and with wrinkled brow I can deal with with the annoyances of the sub-par product.  But I felt that it was important to bring awareness to the fact that either (i) there IS some possibility that illegal paperback copies are being sold, or (ii) that you might get a poorly produced physical copy.  If you prefer an ebook version, maybe go with that.  The PDF version I got after registration seems fine.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning with Python

My own class of undergrads was building DLNN models to do sophisticated image recognition tasks after just a few weeks.So, why the four stars?  Because the book is rather ""paint by the numbers"". The presentation is filled with ""Now you'll do this.."" followed by working blocks of code for the student to enter and run.  But there are no exercises, code or mathematical.  Even the standard backpropagation algorithm is only qualitatively described -- nice pictures of gradient descent in 2 dimensions, but no hard equations.

And as the book ventures into more advanced areas like GANs, VAEs, etc the presentation is increasingly high-level and nonmathematical, providing only a feel for the topics without deep comprehension.  Given the depth of the math involved, I suppose I can't blame Chollet for a bit of handwaving.  But more rigor with deeper explanations would have been nice.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning with Python
"Just finished the first three chapters of this book and you can really feel the enthusiasm of the author. He put so much effort in making the book comprehensible. For example, he doesn't use math equations to explain the theory of neural network but turn to Python code instead. It proves way easier to understand for me, someone working in industry for years. He begins by going straight into our first neural network, stating that ""we have to start somewhere"", which is a very good philosophy. During this ""going straight"" process, he knows exactly when I, as a beginner, will get puzzled and always put hints at the right place in the book, telling me not to worry if I don't something. He also uses a lot of metaphors to express concepts, making it fun to read but without loss of accuracy.This book is up-to-date and it is a masterpiece.Will update this review as I read through the book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning with Python
"The creator of Keras will explain Keras in the best possible way, and there should be no surprise. Let me share an excerpt from the book --""In summary, you do not need to understand anything about the specific architecture of an LSTM cell; as a human, it should not be your job to understand it. Just keep in mind what the LSTM cell is meant to do""SERIOUSLY?So, who should try to understand how LSTM works? These high-level APIs may be making developers' life easy within a few lines of code so that they can rapidly develop ""BLACK BOX"" modules without understanding what's going on inside. It's definitely great for senior design capstone project students. I tell my graduate students to stay far away from using high-level APIs if they want to develop new and custom deep learning models. The author's statement strongly discourages anyone who wants to contribute to AI or needs some insights or explanation of these model behavior and outcome.  No wonder why there are so many code monkeys out there in the industry.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning with Python
"I had high expectations for the book since it was written by the author of the language. I had also just finished Hand-On Machine Learning by Aurelien Geron which was absolutely fabulous and it was serving as a bit of a benchmark. Geron's book is packed full of information and written in a very step by step way. Chollet's book is written in a convoluted round about way and it is difficult to understand his points.The first 100 pages or so is on general deep learning and it is extremely basic. Even though I new these concepts I still found it difficult to follow. The writing is really bad.The more advanced concepts are not any better. Here is an example of the last section I read on page 172 before putting the book down for good.From the section Visualizing heartmaps of class activation""This general category of techniques is called class activation map ( CAM ) visualization,and it consists of producing heatmaps of class activation over input images. A class acti-vation heatmap is a 2D grid of scores associated with a specific output class, computedfor every location in any input image, indicating how important each location is withrespect to the class under consideration. For instance, given an image fed into a dogs-versus-cats convnet, CAM visualization allows you to generate a heatmap for the class“cat,” indicating how cat-like different parts of the image are, and also a heatmap for theclass “dog,” indicating how dog-like parts of the image are.The specific implementation you’ll use is the one described in “Grad- CAM : VisualExplanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization.” 2 It’s very simple:it consists of taking the output feature map of a convolution layer, given an inputimage, and weighing every channel in that feature map by the gradient of the classwith respect to the channel. Intuitively, one way to understand this trick is that you’reweighting a spatial map of “how intensely the input image activates different chan-nels” by “how important each channel is with regard to the class,” resulting in a spatialmap of “how intensely the input image activates the class.”Consider the image of two African elephants shown in figure 5.34 (under a CreativeCommons license), possibly a mother and her calf, strolling on the savanna. Let’s con-vert this image into something the VGG16 model can read: the model was trained onimages of size 224 × 244, preprocessed according to a few rules that are packaged inthe utility function keras.applications.vgg16.preprocess_input . So you need toload the image, resize it to 224 × 224, convert it to a Numpy float32 tensor, and applythese preprocessing rules.After reading this several times I still did not have a good mental formulation of how these heatmaps are put together. I also did not see the need to put in the paragraph about vgg16 preprocessing right here. It is just a distraction from the matter at hand.  The whole book is like this. I was wasting too much energy trying to understand what I believe are basic concepts.I recommend Ina Goodfellow's book on Deep Learning as well as Aurelien Geron's book. For Keras I would recommend the Deeplearning.AI course on Coursera as well as Deep Learning A-Z on Udemy. I do not know of a good Keras book at this time.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning with Python

"I'm a ML engineer. I know the ropes. I've spent hours surfing the web for explanations and sample implementations of deep learning and GAN methodology. You might have too. You might be wondering, ""why would I need this book when I have access to Medium?"" And that's a good question. I can answer that for you.If you've been around for a while, you might know that Medium content can be repetitive, unoriginal, full of too much filler, full of code that can't be re-used, or in the habit of explaining mathematics/probability poorly. The difference between this book and Medium is that this book doesn't do that. It's got good introductions to each popular dataset, contains useful code, is highly readable and refreshing, and uses equations sparingly and effectively, without dumbing down the content too much. I can skim the content easily. It's top notch, contains a lot of fresh developments like World Models (Ch 8), and seems like an essential book for my ML library.My only critique is that at times, the book seemed to read like a children's bedtime story. Telling stories is an excellent way to explain concepts, but I don't know if I need David Foster renaming GAN discriminators and generators ""Di and Gene"", with an introduction on ""taking photographs of ganimals"" to understand what a GAN is. That's not to say this book does the story bit poorly. If you're new to all this, it may be really useful for you. It was just a bit off-putting for me.Regardless, I highly recommend it to anyone that has familiarity with basic stats notation and is comfortable with Python3.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generative Deep Learning: Teaching Machines to Paint Write Compose and Play
"The book starts great. Fantastic examples. It appeals to the reader's intuition and imagination. I loved the beginning and it was very easy working side by side with Jupyter Notebook. The examples are easy to follow and the code is pure Python with Keras. At that point I was going to give the book five stars. However, I was stuck at Autoencoders when the author suddenly started using his own code shortcuts, which was completely unexpected. It took me a while to figure it out that the code was no longer Keras but the functions and objects developed by the author, and imported from the local python files. The book does not explain any of this and the code becomes very obscure. The author's ""models"" and ""utilities"" were clearly meant to simplify development of complex neural networks by the reader. Unfortunately, the code is no longer intelligible as it hides the true Keras APIs. These shortcuts are not really necessary and the code they replace would not add much to the size of the book. In those circumstances, if you move away from the book and the author's Github repository, you will no longer be able to reproduce the models and their tests easily. While it is expected of any practitioner to develop his or her own helper library, this is not suitable for the book which needs simplicity and clarity. In all honesty, the book does not claim to train the reader in Keras at all, however, it uses Keras and asks the reader to install the software, and then explains the basics of model creation with Keras, only to leave it behind. I'd recommend to replace all obscure code with the simplest model creation, which can be found in any Keras example on the web.

"I bought this book with great expectations. Indeed, the first three chapters met those expectations. But at Chap. 4 - Generative Deep Learning - it turned into the book from hell! First off, the author breezily tells us we're going to use the well-known celebrity face file CelebA, and provides a shareable link. But he doesn't tell us how to download a file using a shareable link. And the file is HUGE so it has to be zipped. I spent a day trying to download this file. In the end I gave up and downloaded it from a completely different website using instructions I found on github. That was just the beginning of the ordeal. Then the code the author provided had bugs...lots of bugs. There was the ""objecte can't be pickled bug"", the ""object can't be called"" bug, the ""object called before it has been initialized"" bug and...on and on. In some cases I figured out a workaround. In others I altered the authors code. Finally, the ""ValueError: None values not supported"" bug, buried 11 frames deep into the code, did me in.  I gave up, cursing myself that I had spent a week on this fruitless and ultimately futile effort. I am writing this review to warn prospective buyers of this book. If you're a coding expert (which I'm not), perhaps you will have more luck. But in any case, caveat emptor!",1.0 out of 5 stars,Generative Deep Learning: Teaching Machines to Paint Write Compose and Play
These generative models are both simple and hard. It is a simple idea with a lot of potential and possibility. But it is very hard to make it work.

"I was very interested in looking at this book for the last two chapters - Neuromorphic Computing (NC) and Quantum Computing (QC).  I knew nothing about NC, and I have been studying QC.  I have some background with machine learning.  I found these two chapters to be very fun, informative and easy to read.From the Neuromorphic Computing chapter I learned that Intel Research is working on a neurocomputing chip, containing hundreds to thousands of neurons, and that those chips could be connected to make a network.  Given that there are 100 billion neurons in a human brain, it would take a huge number of chips to be equivalent.  Neurocomputing software, Nengo, is mentioned, which I found interesting, also in the Further Reading section a book written by the author of Nengo is mentioned which describes ""how to build a brain"".  In the chapter, a distinction is made between the neuromorphic computing approach and neural nets.  It is also mentioned that Google's TPU is a specialized chip, that is, hardware designed to work well with the TensorFlow software, and that we can expect more of this in the future.The Quantum Computing chapter is brief, but nice in that it gives a quick introduction, and connects with the previous chapter, Neuromorphic Computing.  It is mentioned that in the future, a quantum computer could represent a brain, which could be called from a classical computer.  A nice, quick, back-of-the-napkin like calculation is done to demonstrate the difference between linear (classical) and exponential (quantum) growth.  The author gives an example of a quantum algorithm he wrote which processes some data and seems to return a number which could be interpreted as a movie ""recommended"" or not.  There's not enough description, I think, of the gates applied to get a good feel about what was done and why, but it's nice in that it's really ""to the point"".  Quantum algorithms seem like a pretty hard topic, but this example is motivating, causing me to think - hey, that sounds neat, it's different from what I had been thinking, what is quantum ML like?  and, to seek out other sources on the topic.Finally, at the end of the book there is a section - Answers to the Questions, which were asked at the end of each chapter.  I enjoyed reading through these to test myself and check the answers against my thoughts.  I liked reading the sections about: 1) the self-driving vehicles, which included a challenge question - would you like to design an autonomous driving system for your city?  2) adding emotional intelligence to chat bots 3) combining methods, for example, reinforcement learning + deep learning, decision trees + k-means clustering, genetic algorithms + neural nets.The author is very bullish on quantum computers, though there is no guarantee that QC's can be developed to the point of being functional, for a real problem.  I too, however, am optimistic.  Via the chapter questions and answers, the author does comment on what existing systems cannot do today; for example, that there currently is no ""general AI"", like a human, but instead, just ""narrow AI"", as in, specific tasks only.I like the breadth.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence Example: Acquire advanced AI machine learning and deep learning design skills 2nd Edition
"Disclaimer: The publisher and asked me to review this book and gave me a review copy. I promise to be 100% honest in how I feel about this book, both the good and the less so.Overview:I have looked through this book, and I have to say that I am disappointed.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the title.  Was it a beginner book?  A cookbook?  A book for experienced practitioners?  After reviewing it, I still don't know.What I Like:This book has something that I hadn't seen in other Packt AI title:  answers to the chapter exercises.  That gave me an initial good feeling about the book, as did seeing that each chapter had a section for Further Reading, something that the more recent Packt titles appear to be doing.Maybe the best thing I have found in this book is how each chapter is structured internally, the microstructure.  The author organizes each chapter the same:  textual comprehension through a use case, mathematical comprehension, example code, a summary, exercises, and further reading.  I personally feel that this is a very structure to have.What I Don't Like:When looking over the TOC, I did not see a well organized structure, a macrostructure.  The author starts with reinforcement learning, then talks about datasets, later talks about blockchain, further on the Internet of Things, a few chapters on chatbots, genetic algorithms, and finishes with quantum computing.  In between some of these are chapters on CNNs, K-Means clustering, and a few topics.  There is no natural flow and some of the topic choices, while interesting, don't really fit.In chapter one, before getting into reinforcement learning, the author spends on section discussing what AI is, followed by his personal learning philosophy.  To quote a section on 'Overcoming real-life issues using the three-step approach', ""First, begin by understanding the subject as a subject matter expert. Then, write the analysis with words and mathematics to make sure your reasoning reflects the subject and, most of all, that the program will make sense in real life. Finally, in step 3, only write the code when you are sure about the whole project.""  In an agile world, this kind of programming gets left in the dust.There are other bits and pieces within the book that I scratched my head over, such as suggesting an online encyclopedia article on the life of the inventor of a technique as further reading.  One of the exercises, which are typically yes/no questions, is 'Can a human beat a chess engine? (Yes | No)'.  And there are odd comments thrown in here and there, such as saying that anyone with a driver's license is an expert driver and so can use driving as an example for problems without consulting anyone else.What I Would Like to SeeMore than anything else, I would like to see a book that is consistently about AI with a macrostructure that flows.  To choose the right macrostructure, this book needs to decide what it is.  If it's a reference, similar topics need to be within a group of chapters.  If it's a beginner's learning book, then it needs to start with a simple topic and work its way toward the more complicated topics.  I loved the proposed structure within the chapters (which unfortunately wasn't always followed clearly enough), but ingredients cooked perfectly don't make a god meal if they don't go together.Overall, I give this book a 2.7 out of 5 stars, rounded up to 3.  The author is clearly knowledgeable on the subject of AI, but they had trouble communicating it to their audience.  I know that I will use this text to gain some important knowledge, but they are unfortunately the diamonds in the rough.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence Example: Acquire advanced AI machine learning and deep learning design skills 2nd Edition
"The book is a decent survey book for AI methods with examples of how they can be applied.  However, like some other AI books, it spans a huge range of topics, and consequently cannot go very deep into any of of the topics.  For example, he goes over Q-learning, CNNs, chatbots, blockchain, IoT, neuromorphic computing, and quantum computing.I did find it a bit rambling at times (with too much fluffy writing), quirky (he uses 'import numpy as ql' instead of 'import numpy as np'), and difficult to understand some of the real-world examples.  The organization of the book also seems a little strange to me (quirky) although given the range of topics in the book, I'm not sure how to better organize it.  Since it spans so many topics, it doesn't cover any one topic in very much depth.  Think of this book of more of a survey of some AI methods out there.AI topics are already very hard to understand, so I don't fault the author for that and appreciate the work he put into the book.  However, the warehouse example in chapters 2/3 seems to be ill-explained.  It seems like the author forgot to explain some assumptions about the application.  I also wish there was more of a summary at the beginning explaining how everything ties together since the book contains many disparate subjects.  The book doesn't have deep reinforcement learning algorithms like policy gradient and related methods, but that could be an entire book on its own.I was disappointed by the blockchain section.  The author did not describe or explain Bitcoin properly, and IBM's hyperledger is basically a timestamped list of entries as far as I understand (not a good or very useful blockchain, basically).  I get the feeling the author probably adapted or expanded on some examples from IBM on using AI with hyperledger, but am not sure of this.  One quote from the blockchain section that made me cringe was:""Whether the goal is to mine bitcoins through blocks or use blocks for transactions,artificial intelligence will enhance this innovation shortly.""All bitcoin blocks are composed of bitcoin transactions, as that's the entire point of bitcoin.Overall, the book was decent, but I got the feeling it could be 3 or 4 books based on the range of topics discussed.  AI books tend to be like that, however -- combining many subjects under one cover.I am excited to further check out the chatbot sections because I haven't thoroughly looked at those.  Again, you could easily write an entire book on chatbots, so there is probably a lot missing in the few chapters on chatbots.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence Example: Acquire advanced AI machine learning and deep learning design skills 2nd Edition
"“Artificial Intelligence By Example” by Denis Rothman is the “Rosetta Stone of Artificial Intelligence” and a masterpiece in translating AI into usable concepts for practitioners.  My congratulations to the author Denis Rothman for writing a book that deserves your time and should be in your library.I say Rosetta Stone because the actual stone, not the software program, contained three languages, Ancient Greek and Egyptian in both hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts. In much the same way, this book works on three distinctively different levels, making it unique in what is now an ever-growing selection of AI books promising proficiency written by people with limited experience implementing real solutions.For developers, teachers, and students, there are ample examples that tie directly into Python, TensorFlow, and other standard libraries for practical hands-on examples that you can code yourself.  The examples are straight forward and picked with an emphasis on practical application.  You will be using libraries that are industry standards, and what you learn can be directly applied on the job.  The examples will not waste your time and have a real focus on problems I've seen in AI deployments in the real world.The second level this book is fine-tuned to project managers or consultants leading the developers mentioned above.  For you, this book will be indispensable.  The author does a fantastic job of explaining in clear terms what AI concepts mean not just in terms of coding, but in how they impact your solution and the problem it solves.  He does this without jargon, and in clear, practical terms.  Read this book (skip the ample coding sections), and you will have a better grasp of technical answers for both your clients and your developers.  More importantly, read this, and your developers cannot take advantage of you!  Running AI projects as a subject matter expert either as a manager or consultant can be a challenge, and this book will give you the deep grasp of AI you need to succeed.The book worked at a third level for me in that it discusses the basic mathematics that underlies the constructs of AI.  “The foundation of machine learning and deep learning relies on mathematics.""  All too often, I see AI sold as a magical black box devoid of the underlying mathematical foundations.  While it may sound seductive, ignoring the math is a fast-track to failure.  The author does a great job of introducing the basic mathematical constructs AI is built upon and, in doing so, demystifies how AI works.  Kudos to Denis for covering this and making it accessible to all.This book was a pleasure to read, even if the coding went beyond my skills, with plenty of hard-learned examples of how humans see the world in contrast with AI.  The juxtaposition of how machines see our world versus humans is a central theme throughout.  It is useful because it continuously highlights why, and how, to examine the results AI gives us before blindly believing them.I work as a project manager and team leader in AI innovation projects.  I've watched my team wrestle with many of the problems the author lays out and wish I had this book years ago.  I thoroughly enjoyed Artificial Intelligence by Example, it is worthy of your time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence Example: Acquire advanced AI machine learning and deep learning design skills 2nd Edition
"A couple of years ago I went to see Jimmy Cliff performing live. In a break between two songs he said: “Have you heard of SkaRock? Let me tell you about it; I was there at the beginning.” Jimmy Cliff’s performance was the highlight of clarity in a reggae festival that sometimes sounded more like a cacophony.Reading Denis Rothman’s book on Artificial Intelligence had the same effect on me as that live moment. In today’s market of AI related books and articles, his voice is one of clarity based on both personal experience (yes, he was there at the beginning of chat bots, deep learning and reinforced learning), and on a critical semiotic mind that goes beyond the code to explain how the codes come to signify, and how that signification can be understood and re-interpreted by us, the users.I read this book as a non-coder, but as an anthropologist, interested in how AI is produced and produces in its turn a new environment in which we work and live. For this reason I skipped the large part dedicated to pure coding and concentrated on the practical applications proposed, as well as on the interpretative part based on mathematics. As such, the chapter on emotion and chatbots was highly rewarding.As someone who worked in consulting and evaluation, I found the chapter of “Evaluation Beyond Human Analytic Capacity” highly informative. It shows how AI applied in management can transform mechanisms of command and control for a greater efficiency and may engender better collaboration between humans (and between humans and machines). As such, this book is indispensable for the future of management and leadership practices.The book’s last 3 chapters represent the final reward for any inquisitive mind that wants to go beyond the technicalities of AI and its application into meditating on the future of merging the two types of codes: genetic and human made computational codes - and how the future may look like in the quantum computational world. If it sounds like cyberpunk, it is because it may as well be. Only that with Denis Rothman’s book, and under his critical and informed perspective, the future is here.If your life is touched by AI - and if you are reading this, it surely is - this book is indispensable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence Example: Acquire advanced AI machine learning and deep learning design skills 2nd Edition

"When stepping on the new or unfamiliar area, the first step might grab reference out there to understand ""WHAT IS IT ?"" However, I'm afraid to say that it's not easy to find proper references which help us understand the core concept of it. — some are too academic holding alien equations, the alternative are too practical, which make us think that we were in programming classes. Personally, I'm a sacrifice as a learner depending too much on the first. It's passed quite long time that I understand EM.In that sense, not biased either of the above-mentioned examples, I definitely believe that this book is the right one to guide readers to understand the concept of algorithms. In the every chapter, author's clever guide keep readers from falling in the rabbit hole. In addition, practical examples give readers more understandable on what's handled in the chapter. I especially recommend this book to students/teachers as class materials, developers, self-learners and anyone who are interested in.

"There is only one way to learn data science: With a solid understanding of the underlying theory, and by getting your hands dirty with real examples, data, and code. AI by example delivers exactly this mix, with examples that go beyond contrived toy boxes, and real code on git.While I wish the book had a chapter how to assure ML by scrutinizing data, debugging models, assessing model competence, and how to apply general software engineering principles as algorithms are derived from data, I understand that these issues concern a more experienced audience and would be out of scope for beginners. Still, I can see this book as a reference even for more experienced professionals, and it would be great to see these aspects considered in a third edition.That said, this book is equally for developers who need to learn how to build solid machine learning programs, project managers and consultants need to learn what ML is and is not capable of, as well as teachers and students who get a comprehensive overview of the key aspects of AI, along with their first hands-on experience training models.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence Example: Acquire advanced AI machine learning and deep learning design skills 2nd Edition

"Let me be very clear.  I am not interested in leaving reviews unless I am firmly compelled to do so.  This summer I was interested in NLP and knowing John Liu in the Nashville data science community, I thought I would give it a read.  Now, as many of these books go, it is a comprehensive books that is not best read cover to cover.  But instead, start with the beginning and then find the sections that are best suited for you.This is a book that may be a little tough for the beginner, but it is very well written that even the novice will understand their chapters on machine learning and the basics of deep learning.  I was very interested in learning more about recurrent and concurrent neural networks and this book did not disappoint.  I do have some mathematics background, but even without this knowledge, I feel that I would have still understood the book.Well done and thank you writing a book on this subject that will be interesting for a wide range of individuals.  Its practical basis made it easy to follow and (believe it or not) a joy to read.  This will be my reference for NLP and speech recognition.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for NLP and Speech Recognition
"“Deep Learning for NLP and Speech Recognition” is a comprehensive text that walks the reader through a complex topic in a thoughtful and easily consumable way.  Chapter 3 on “Text and Speech Basics” sets the stage for contextual understanding of natural language processing, critical for the ability to apply algorithms effectively to speech data. The authors weave Python snippets of analysis and case studies throughout the text, making application of the methodologies easy for the learner. Over 13 chapters, the concepts build upon each other, and the reader walks away with a comprehensive study of NLP and several deep learning methodologies, which can be applied to non-NLP problems. I especially enjoyed section 7.6, as the authors deftly describe how to convert language data and word embeddings into inputs for a recurrent neural network. Extensive and thorough resource for both scientists with proficient knowledge of NLP and scientists just getting started.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning for NLP and Speech Recognition
"A great resource for having the concept, theory and the use cases all in one place. Not only basic NLP concepts such as word embeddings, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent networks are well explained with NLP domain, but the case study covers many standard and advanced methods in each using Keras or PyTorch very well. There are very few books or resources that cover the advanced chapters such as the Attention & Memory Networks, Domain Adaptation, and Reinforcement learning in a comprehensive way with the case studies, so definitely a big plus!

Some concepts are not explained well at all but the code is fairly easy to follow if you are late beginner or early intermediate of python.

"This book gives you a hands-on approach to learning by doing Python for Machine Learning. As opposed to many Machine learning books that dive deep into the theory without any practical explanation, this book explained all the ML approaches using Python and Visualization.It gives you a great deal of context and useful tools for solving all kinds of Machine Learning problems. In the deep learning chapter, you will get an excellent overview and the background to understand when and where to apply the various techniques starting from ANN, CNN to RNN. LSTM is also. Very well explained with a very excellent example.The book is code-focused, so you'll have the option to run working code on real problems throughout the book. The data and codes are available on the author Github rep.Most essential for me too, he focuses on explanation over equations that are rampant in other ML books. Unlike other books, the author is skipped the hard-part of breaking complicated concepts down into chunks that can be consumed by a competent beginner.Moreover, this author does so without dumbing down the content. That's the mark of someone who well understands both the content and the audience.The publication quality of the print edition is excellent. If you need the colour version, don't hesitate to get the pdf version available for download.

You’ll also be expected to set up your own targets for the scripts you write with very little explanations from the authors. In the grand scheme of things, these drawbacks (and overcoming them to get the examples to work) just reinforce the teaching of a “hacker” mindset in my opinion so it’s not that big a deal.

It’s interesting to see how one can set up maximum likelihood with non-constant variance using neural networks. Bayesian neural network layers can be introduced via flipout or dropout layers, for which the authors provide basic intuition and explanation of benefits. Another intriguing concept was normalizing flow, which appears to allow for modeling any complex multidimensional distributions using mathematical tricks and neural networks( while it is still unclear to me how to assess the quality of the models).

"An exceptionally well written and crafted description on the main RL techniques now being applied by practitioners.  The text and code base is precise and to the point on describing the essentials, in clear and relevant style.

Following a thorough introduction of 'basic' DQN networks, the book goes into Reinforce policy gradient methods  and  Actor Critic methods before going into advanced methods on Genetic methods, distributed probability distributed DQN, curiosity driven and multi Agents. This book makes you think and experiment mixing across the different techniques, and help orientate the understanding of advanced RL techniques.  The book is reasonably current.The style of this book is to teach you to understand core and advanced RL concepts, with convincing code, to put the reader into a position to understand and apply the emergent RL algorithms developments using pytorch.  So I would believe it should be possible to understand and apply the recently developed Deep Mind Mu One algorithm, after reading through and experimenting around the examples in this book.Note however,  to still be aware of the Reinforcement Learning hype, as it still does not really generalise any convincing performance beyond the standard toy examples, with so many hyper parameters and reward shaping  being necessary to get good or even basic pragmatic performance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Reinforcement Learning in Action

"I felt compelled to write a review because I really think this is an exceptionally good book under the circumstances. When I say ""under the circumstances"", I mean given the fact that deep learning is a challenging topic to explain and requires both a theoretic and practical approach to be appreciated. The author clearly avoids getting bogged down with the theoretical aspects and I can appreciate why since a thorough theoretical understanding would require a separate book in it's own right.This book will not help you understand the theory or underlying mathematics. However, if you already understand the theory and want to learn to use a package like Keras then this is the book for you.This book stands out because it gives details about the implementation aspects of coding many different deep learning models that you will hear about in the literature and in the field. For example, LeNet, ResNet, etc. among many others are demonstrated through out the book.Generally speaking, topics in deep learning are not easy to explain to the average reader and I think the author recognizes this difficulty and chooses to place his focus on demonstrating how to implement deep learning methods and being careful to explain what the different modules do and their respective parameters.In my view, this book is very suitable for Data Scientists who already know the spectrum of machine learning models and techniques and want to get their hands dirty as fast as possible with deep learning.  This book is a much better practical book for deep learning than the popular book by Aurélien Géron called ""Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems"". I have looked at many deep learning books and in my view this one did the best job is getting me comfortable with implementing deep learning models on my own.The one thing that I found the book was lacking is that it's final chapter on AI and reinforcement learning did not seem as thorough and detailed as the other chapters in the book.

I would have liked to see more about the inner-workings of Keras-- how it works, not just how to use it.  Overall, I highly recommend this book to technically-proficient deep learning enthusiasts.

Read half of it. The examples are ok but the theory explanation of what you are doing are very basic - not enough to understand the theory without some further background. And the coding part is just a cookbook presentation - here it is. Not a lot of depth.Have not tried to run the code samples yet.I was hoping for a bit more. Maybe given that keras sits on top of tensorflow or Theano there is just not as much to say?This book contains many code examples and log traces showing execution of the code. The code and log traces are formatted like code on a computer screen and look very washed out (print book). Bolder fonts and a little ink would have made this book a lot easier to read.

Don't get his book unless you have a good understanding of NLP . If read  the book Getting Started with Google BERT first this book will make so much more sense. The two combined will leave you with a great understanding of transformers and the models that used them. Good examples there are a couple that don't work or require a lot of modifications to get working even in Colab.

"This is a great book for anyone new to the subject of deep learning applied to AI. The author goes to great lengths to explain each topic in sufficient detail to understand it. He then follows it up with a python program to illustrate the key aspect of the topic. The Transformers model is explained in detail with the simplified attention getting as their key to encoding  and decoding. BERT is then one of the metric programs often used for measuring the performance of the particular NLP app, Transformers in this case. The author goes further in explaining how Bert does it. This opens the door to using it for other mappings. Thus the book handles roBERTa, GLUE, SuperGlue and etc.The chapters on translations and generation are particularly interesting because it leads to a discussion of generation and GPT-2 and GPT-3. This is a topic that requires massive computing because of the number of words involved in their data, (540 M) and (1.75 Billions, 8 10000 PCs) respectively. Three of the later chapters are devoted to word extraction.

"This book, as many others about the ""NLP transformers revolution"", has almost no interest. It is just a collection of verbiage made upon easy notebooks reimplementing the typical Python snippets available freely on the HF and AllenNLP websites. It is almost a shame to see so many editors publishing such works which do not bring anything new about the subjects and at best reproduce the knowledge proposed for FREE on HF or AllenNLP websites. Let's take the example of Chapter 10 about QA. The author proposes to generate questions to be asked to the QA pretrained model. He is proposing to use NER for identifying entities in the text context and then writes a snippet to hardcode questions based on the entity categories.... OMG, it is not at all how we do such questions generation process with Transformers... If you want to start discussing how to generate questions from a context (and honestly I do not see the point here), at least use a Transformer model in an inverse close tasks manner. You will teach something new to your readers and keep credibility at the same time.So to summarize, do not waste your money with this kind of books pretending to teach you how to do NLP with Transformers. Plan 2 months of homework studying HF, Stanza and AllenNLP repo and watch the Stanford YouTube videos from Manning.

"It is well-known that Transformers have taken the NLP world by storm in the last couple of years. Transformers are essentially language models trained in a self-supervised manner using vast amounts of text. The knowledge and reasoning skills they pick up during this training has been surprisingly effective at solving many NLP problems, using a process called transfer learning. Using this process, transformers can be used as-is or fine tuned to a particular task, using much less labeled data than was possible before Transformers. As a result, Transformers have become indispensable for both academic research and industrial practice in NLP.In my case, I had some familiarity with Transformers prior to reading the book, in the sense that I had fine-tuned a few Transformer models and ran inference on them, both natively and using the Huggingface API. However, my understanding of Transformers had been ad-hoc and driven by the needs of the application.The major benefit of this book for me has been its comprehensive coverage. The book starts with the theory behind Transformers and basic operations such as pre-training and fine-tuning and the rationale behind them. After the first few introductory chapters, each chapter covers individual applications of Transformers in a very example-driven manner, introducing the most appropriate model for the task. Applications cover standard tasks such as classification, sequence classification, as well as esoteric ones such as semantic role labeling, and few and zero shot learning. Discussions cover not only the transformer related portions of the application, but other aspects as well, including datasets, data pre-processing and evaluation. The Transformer models covered include not only the popular ones such as BERT, GPT-3 and T5, but also less well-known ones such as RoBERTa and ELECTRA. Examples are provided using the HuggingFace (both Pytorch and Tensorflow), AllenNLP, and Trax (Google Brain) libraries.As a NLP practitioner, Transformers need to be part of your toolkit, and this book can help. Even if you have used Transformers in your work before, this book will likely teach you something new that will make you more effective with them (check the Table of Contents).DISCLAIMER: I was provided with a free review copy of the book and requested to provide an honest review, which I have done above.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Transformers for Natural Language Processing: Build innovative deep neural network architectures for NLP with Python PyTorch TensorFlow BERT RoBERTa and more
"About This BookThis is the first book available about the use of transformers in natural language processing. It’s the technique that the top NLP models use as of this writing. It goes into detail about the architecture of transformers before looking at some of the NLP models. I would say that this is THE book to read to go deep into NLP for research or development.Who Is This For?This book is for the developer or researcher with a basic knowledge of natural language processing as well as a good handle on Python programming. I would recommend you wait to read this if you don’t know anything about NLP or are still learning Python. This book also makes my required reading list for AI.OrganizationThe author sets up the book in three overall sections, as per the preface, though the table of contents makes no reference to this macrostructure. I feel this is in error, as a strong macrostructure makes the book more readable. The microstructure is more like what you typically see from Packt, though they add in a Questions section at the end of each chapter. The questions seem to all be true/false, which aids a bit with recall. With how deep the author goes, I would have liked to see deeper questions that the reader can follow up with to gain a better understanding of the content.Did This Book Succeed?This book fully succeeds in teaching the reading about the use of transformers, particularly in NLP. A chapter on the use of transformers outside of NLP would have been nice, as well, but I understand that the author kept in their domain so that they could go and stay deep.Rating and Final ThoughtsOverall, I give this book a 5 out of 5.This is the second book you should read if you are just starting out in natural language processing, but very much required. It is also useful for an AI generalist since the transformer seems to have applications outside of pure NLP, as we will likely see in the near future.

"This is a great book that will catch the reader up on most of the major advances in deep learning applied to healthcare over the last few years. It has a great curated list of many important papers / publications in the field since the dawn of the deep learning era, presented as case studies in each chapter. The breadth of coverage is great both in deep learning methods as well as healthcare use cases.Deep learning methods cover the usual CNNs, RNNs, Seq-to-Seq models (attention), Transformers but also topics like autoencoders & its variants, Graph Neural Nets and GANs which I have not seen covered in many other sources.Similarly, healthcare use cases covered range from EHRs, radiology all the way to drug discovery, clinical trial matching, medication recommendation, synthetic data generation and many other really fascinating topics.Prof. Jimeng Sun also recently released an excellent 3-course Coursera specialization that I think complements this book very well - it follows the book pretty much chapter by chapter. This course is right up there (while still being unique) along with the handful of other important courses in AI + healthcare released in recent years.Lastly, the authors also have a YouTube channel 'AIforhealth' where short explanations of important papers are posted.

"As a PhD student doing research on deep learning at a US university, I find this book really helpful for in-depth explanations on the math and theory behind deep learning. For example, nearly all of my colleagues ""sort of"" know how CNN and LSTM work, but only a few really understand how back-propagation is performed in the convolution and pooling layers of CNN, why the vanishing or exploding gradient problem happens in a vanilla RNN, etc. Without understanding them, it is hard to propose improvements, invent new models, etc. In other words, we need to learn the math to do research on deep learning.However, most of the existing textbooks fail to address our needs, because they either (1) bear an application flavor, focusing on TensorFlow/Keras/Matlab/... programming too much, or (2) have rigorous treatment of math but cover machine learning in general, not deep learning specifically. What's worse, US universities at the current stage (2018) typically do not offer course on deep learning, or do offer such courses which are too popular for students to enroll in. As a reference, my university offered such a course with 200+ seats but got full within the first few days of course registration. Resorting to the original papers on CNN, LSTM, etc. for in-depth math discussions could be an option, but it is more time and energy consuming than reading such a neatly written textbook with consistent notations and easy-to-follow explanations.Overall, highly recommend this to deep learning researchers!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pro Deep Learning with TensorFlow: A Mathematical Approach to Advanced Artificial Intelligence in Python

"Wishing to learn about TensorFlow, I decided to survey TF books available from Amazon, and pick one or two for further study.

Two weeks later, I am still not done - the book by Shukla has not arrived - but the picture is reasonably clear.The books by Van Boxel, Zaccone, Karim, Zaccone and Karim, Bonnin, Hua and Azeem, and Ghotra and Dua can be skipped - see my reviews of those titles for detail. The remaining five choices fall into three clusters. First, the book by Hope and Resheff provides a good-quality introduction to TensorFlow. Second, the Packt-published titles by McClure, Fandango and Gulli and Kapoor are serviceable, substantial books that compensate for less polish with more coverage.Finally, far away from the rest, stands ""Pro Deep Learning with TensorFlow"" - which probably has the least TensorFlow code among the five books, and instead looks very much like a *textbook* discussing the problems and the algorithms associated with TensorFlow. The review by Seth Harris is quite right in telling ""programmers who want to just get hacking and incorporate understanding as they go"" to look elsewhere - with ""Pro Deep Learning"", the first thing to hack will be 100+ pages of linear algebra. ""Pro Deep Learning"" is not the right book for me - I don't need as much ""theory"", and do need more TensorFlow know-how - so I did not examine it in great detail, but my first and second impressions are very positive. The textbook material can’t be original, but it has been diligently collected, interpreted and integrated, making for a smooth and un-padded narrative.

The book seems geared toward people who already have a strong grasp of the concepts it covers, despite its inclusion of mathematics brush-ups at the beginning.My sense from looking through it is that it may prove useful as a reference book once the concepts have been learned from elsewhere. But as a first-time introduction, I think it might suit people with strong math backgrounds, as opposed to people with strong programming backgrounds.

She gives stunning evidence and concrete recommendations for building meaningful play into early-childhood curriculum to support rigor and growth-mindset. I have been waiting for a long time for a  supporting body of evidence for what I have intrinsically known is best for kids. I am so happy to have this knowledgeable and inspirational resource.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purposeful Play: A Teachers Guide to Igniting Deep and Joyful Learning Across the Day

"This is a very nice book.  I am looking at it to learn what generative models are, and I am specifically interested in the use case of predicting protein structure.  The book hits the spot in introducing me to both of these topics.The first chapter explains the difference between generative models and models that are more common such as linear and logistic regression.  In the case of generative models, rather than using a fitted formula to predict an output, we either 1) sample from (x, y) or 2) we start with a target y, and sample the x.  There  are several types of generative models: Naive Bayes Classifiers, Gaussian Mixture Models, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models, Hidden Markov Models, Deep Boltzmann Machines, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  The last three of these types are deep neural network models.The second chapter goes through, in careful detail, setting up a programming environment which provides a foundation for reproducible applications.  TensorFlow and Keras are used due to their widespread usage. Interesting background on TensorFlow is provided.  The setup for programming includes: open source code editor, VSCode, as IDE, Docker for creating a reproducible Python ""execution environment"" (Python language version and libraries), Kubernetes for managing applications with multiple containers  (each container could be responsible for a different task), Kubeflow built on top of Kubernetes has several components useful in the ""end-to-end process of managing ML applications"", Katib - a utility built into Kubeflow enables optimizing models for parameter grids, Jupyter Notebooks can be started in a namespace using Kubeflow, Kubeflow can be deployed on AWS, Azure, and GCP, and Terraform is a template language whose instructions can be used to install Kubeflow on any of the cloud platforms.It is a long list, but each piece provides something useful.Chapter 3 covers the ""building blocks of deep neural networks"" to help understand the theory behind the code.  This is a valuable chapter to build an understanding of the progression from perceptrons to multi-layer perceptrons and backpropagation.  Backpropagation is described, including with math formulas.Different types of networks are described: convolution, recursive, and networks for sequence data.  Also, there is a section on ""building a better optimizer"".  There is a long list of useful references with links, at the  end of the chapter, including some papers by Hinton.The next 10 chapters cover use cases, with code blocks: generating digits, painting pictures, generating images, creating deep fakes and transferring styles (like replacing one person's face with another's, converting a horse into a zebra, creating a painting from a photo), generating text, composing music, playing video games, and emerging applications, such as finding new drugs, predicting protein structure, solving PDEs, creating videos from images, and generating food recipes.For the two drug applications described in the last chapter, it is a short section with no code, though, the reader is referred back to earlier chapters where there is code for a model type.  The writing is very to the point, with excellent diagrams to provide an understanding of the problem and the approach.  The list of references at the end of the last chapter, Emerging Applications, includes a link to the DeepMind blog entry for AlphaFold: Using AI for scientific discovery (i.e. protein folding).The book clearly and carefully covers a lot.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models
"This book covers the most advanced explicit density based generative models (RBM, VAE, etc.) and implicit density based generative models (GAN, etc.).  It also gives detailed tutorials on using Keras, the most popular deep learning tool, to build these models. In particular, it also shows how to distribute large-scale deep learning models on multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cloud servers (e.g., AWS). This is very essential for model training such as GAN that has huge number of parameters as well as a large number of image samples.In the first chapter, the authors introduced the basic concepts of generative models and discriminative models. They clarified the difference by introducing the Bayes probability model behind them. It helped reader sort out the general discriminant models (linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, etc.), and know how generative model works. They also introduced the different types of generative models and their applications. This chapter is very important to the beginners.In the second chapter, the authors gave a detailed tutorial to build the development environment. However, the build environment of this book is based on MacOS (this should have been mentioned), but according to my experience, many people in industry and especially academic use Linux.In the third chapter, the authors briefly reviewed the build blocks of the deep learning models including, perceptrons, hidden layers, loss function, activate function,optmizer, etc. These are all essential components for a deep neural network. Even most of them are build-in components in the recent AI packages, but understanding them can help  the developers know deeper about their networks.The rest of the chapters talked about different types of generative models from  Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Variational Autoencoders (VAE), to NLP and reinforce learning generative models. For each model, the author always first gave the mathematical description, and then showed the implementation process. I think understanding the theory behind each model is critical for practical using. There is a little thing can be improved when describing the math explanation. Some symbols in the formula and text are inconsistent, for example the epsilon and e.Among all the generative models in the book, the GAN family attracts me the most. The author introduced the development process from vanilla GAN, conditional GAN ​​to progressive GAN. They also taught two of the most exciting applications of GAN: style transfer and face transfer (deep fake). At the end of each part, they also discussed the challenges and potential research direction of the each generative model. In summary, this is a good manual for the people of deep learning in industry and academia.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models
"Generative models learn a distribution of data for a given class, as opposed to Discriminative models, which learn the probability of a class given the data. When we talk of models in Machine Learning, we are generally talking about Discriminative models. However, of late, Generative models have become easier to create, and the ability to create and use them are becoming an essential skill for most ML practitioners. This book is therefore not only very timely, it also provides a very comprehensive coverage about popular types of Generative models, mostly in the area of Computer Vision (CV), but Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) use cases are covered as well. Models covered in the CV area are Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In the NLP area, coverage includes pre-Transformer (RNN, Language Models) and post-Transformer (Autoregressive models such as GPT-2 and GPT-3) models. Application in the RL area is also explored, where a Generative model can be used as the world-model or Environment which takes a state action pair and generates a new action. There is also a chapter on novel applications of Generative models, such as generating novel molecular structures, protein folding, etc.Overall, this book provides a very comprehensive and in-depth coverage of Generative models. At the same time, unlike other books that cover this subject, the book does not demand a skill/knowledge threshold from its readers. As a result, it can appear wordy at times. Code examples are in Tensorflow, but since the authors use Tensorflow 2, Pytorch users will be able to follow along quite easily as well.DISCLAIMER: I was asked by the publisher if I would like to review the book, and I was provided with a free copy of the book when I agreed.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models
"About This BookThis book covers image generation, deepfakes, composing music, and much more. It begins with the basic knowledge required, moves on to setting up your system, gives you the foundation of the field, and then covers a wide range of applications.Who Is This For?This book is for anyone who is interested in generating creative works using AI techniques. It’s a great way to learn how to fight against deepfakes, generate text, or create photorealistic images of people who do not exist. It’s an interesting application of AI that is improving at a vast rate.OrganizationThe macrostructure of the book is set up well. There are no high-order groupings of the chapters, which is a minor loss, but the skills you need to accomplish the projects later in the book are built up earlier. Each chapter covers its topic well, summarizes what you read, and then gives all of the chapters’ references. Overall, a good organization.Did This Book Succeed?If you work through this book from beginning to end, or at least the foundational chapters and the application chapters you’re interested in, you will get a LOT out of this book. I have no doubt that you will then be able to work through recent research papers, deconstruct open source applications, or create your own AI-enabled art.Rating and Final ThoughtsOverall, I give this book a 5 out of 5.This is a great book to add to your personal AI library, even if it’s not your area of focus. Just makes sure to do the projects and extend them to make sure you comprehend the material. There is much to learn here, so don’t miss out.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models
"The main things I really loved about this book are the code and Chapter 6. Chapter 6 gives an excellent framework for how to compare the various flavors of generative models and GANs and abstracts them away in a common architecture so I now feel like it would be pretty easy to learn about a new GAN architecture. The code on Github makes this even easier because you can just pull in the repo in a Google collab notebook and see for yourself how everything works. https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Generative-AI-with-Python-and-TensorFlow-2The main weakness this book has is it ends up repeating lots of content like for e.g the basic code for discriminators and generators or explaining way too many things that aren't really essential to understanding generative models like a comprehensive overview of neural networks or cloud deployments with Terraform and on Google, AWS and Azure etc.. which detract away from how clear chapters like chapter 6 are.As far as the examples go, the NLP section is weak relative to the audio and image sections with the image sections definitely being the star of the show.All the content that's not Generative modeling focused may still be valuable if this is the first deep learning book you've bought but if it's not and you're really buying this to learn more about GANs and friends then you can read Chapter 1, 6 and 9 and skim the rest.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models
"This book is for self-motivated learners who are willing to do the examples. This is a “doing” book! Fork the GitHub. Setup your Dev environment. Run the exercises. Experiment. Use a dataset that you know. Then, move to next chapter. Your effort will be rewarded with a practical skill-set that you can demo to colleagues in exciting new (generative) ways.You should be at an immediate-level with Machine Learning concepts and Python-related skills. A few beginning ML courses (or equivalent) are sufficient. Knowing a bit about TF/Keras or PyTorch is helpful.I ditto the previous review by HawkInFlight, which has a nice summary of the topics of the early chapters. In these chapters, the authors cover an incredible diversity, both in ML tech (VAE to GAN and back again!) and in dataset modes (handwritten digits, images, style transfer, deep-fakes, text gen, music, video).I was particularly impressed by how the first three chapters eases the learner into executing code in Chapter 4 on MNIST images. So, pay attention to these chapters! Revisit as needed.The first chapter is a gentle intro into Bayes Theorem that forms the concept basis for discriminative versus generative learning. Nice twist on the usual contrast between supervised versus un(self)-supervised learning.The second chapter packs lot into sketching a full cloud-base ML development environment, complete with… TF2, Keras, VSCode, Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, AWS+GCP+Azure, Teraform.

"This book does an excellent job of covering a very large number of relevant topics in the area of generative models, with focus on deep-learning based models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The authors guide the reader from the basics of deep-learning and GANs, all the way to advanced and exotic applications such as drug discovery, music generation and PDE solving using GANs, as well as a detailed survey of deep-fakes, their technical challenges, implications, and ethical issues. Topics are explained in detail but kept quite accessible, making this a great reference for beginners as well as seasoned deep-learning practitioners. Discussions are almost always followed by a hands-on section, where Python code snippets are provided to illustrate how specific solutions can be implemented in TensorFlow (the authors use the Keras API, which greatly improves readability of TensorFlow code). The only small flaw I can point out is that several equations throughout the book are printed as low-def images, which is a bit unsightly. This does not compromise readability, though, and I hope it gets fixed in future editions.

"A few years ago, I was fascinated by Generative AI while reading Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet. The book was not about generative AI, and only 1 chapter was devoted to a high-level view and some great examples.Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2 goes into a deeper dive with Generative AI, starting with controlling a fleet of servers to a fast crash course in Deep Neural Networks. By Chapter 4, you're already generating data, which is mostly text. The explanations of each subject are fantastic, and I'm deeply grateful for all the graphics the authors provided to explain. I don't work with matrices daily, so I find the formulas very useful.I'm still going through the book, but there was one particular reason I was interested in it. Chapter 11 is about Music Generation, which is another part I find fascinating. While it's mostly an explanation of different models to analyze music, I find that I was looking for just that. - If you're looking to get started with Generating things with Generative AI, this is a great place to start. - If you're a seasoned AI generator, the main advantage of this book is using Tensorflow 2 for its examples, but you probably already saw this material from other places.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2: Create images text and music with VAEs GANs LSTMs Transformer models

This book assumes you have a good handle on machine learning concepts, but does start with a review of Bayes. It then jumps right into Tensorflow and companion tools for development such as Docker, AWS and Kubeflow.  Definitely a long way from toy examples in a Jupyter notebook.

It tries to cover many different domains of AI, starting with introduction to neural networks, ending with deep reinforcement learning.

I plan to spend the next 4mo studying this material and executing the 9 projects. I've had the book for two weeks and so far am not impressed. The first project uses a MLP NN for solving the MNIST handwritten digit problem and concludes the MLP model is not accurate enough (85%). I would have skipped the MLP and just started with the CNN NN. I have done this based on online tutorials and the accuracy was greater than 97%. The book is light on content. On each subject it has a few introductory words then a link to other sources for content and a walk-through on the project code.

"There are two reasons why we use research in professional learning. One is so that we can connect our practice to what research shows. Does our practice show evidence of what is fud in the research or not? The second reason is to cause some cognitive dissonance, to make us think and question. In Cultivating Curiosity in K-12 Classrooms, Wendy Ostroff does both. She provides lots of research about curiosity and the benefits it brings to learners of all ages. Ostroff also challenges us to look for ways we can do more in our learning environments.Each chapter contains a couple of “Curiosity Techniques to Try,” some of which you have probably tried in the past, may be using now, or have thought about trying. Each chapter also contains a Quick Recap and In Sum section for the big ideas.

This is certainly not exclusive to this particular use case.If I had any complaint at all about the book, it's that it is overly thorough so you may find yourself slogging through some tedium as you begin.  It's not broken up in a way that easily allows for skipping ahead (at least not for my prior knowledge set).

"I have been reading the book for three days.I must say that I am really disappointed for several reasons:1) The figures are in black and white. There would be any problem with it unless some figures can be only understood with original color. For example, in Fig. 4.6 the author is comparing the Kalman Filter vs Moving average. How am I supposed to understand which line is the price filtered with the Kalman Filter and which other line is the MA if they are all continuous gray lines? I am expecting this problem to appear more times in this book2) The author really assumes the reader is familiar with a lot of finance concepts and definitions. Most of these definitions are very simple (just google them), but the author makes them so difficult to understand that make you feel frustrated. After googling some of the concepts I didn't understand, I just realized the author is not really a good teacher.3) The book is really BIG. The problem is that most of the sentences are about what we will learn in other chapters - just a list of names and topics that we will eventually learn (and we won't).4) I understand that the book is very dense and full of parts of code, but I was expecting a deep explanation of the most important parts of the codes. instead, the author just copy and paste the code o his notebook and he leaves to the reader the duty to understand it.

I can accept all these (and still find it useful). My biggest complain is the quality of the presentation, especially the pictures are shown as a tiny box in my Kindle reader (on iPad) and there is not way to enlarge and see it (extremely low resolution).

"Tonight, I completed reading of Laurence Moroney’s book “AI and Machine Learning for Coders”. I enjoyed this book from cover to cover, and I am especially thankful for a few things.First, this book did a great job of explaining how tensorflow can be used to solve different types of problems, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. It even went into text generation, which got my creativity going.Second, this book is written for coders, but it does explain how neural networks work at a high level. It doesn’t drop a wall of math on the reader, which I appreciated. I feel much more comfortable now, after reading this.And finally, the book ends by discussing interpretability, bias/fairness, and Google’s AI principles. I found that to be a beautiful ending.I give this five stars. The few issues I had were trivial. This book is outstanding. I’m so much better off for having read it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,AI and Machine Learning for Coders: A Programmers Guide to Artificial Intelligence

"Likes:- It is a good intro for student of AI and machine learning.- It helps you get a grasp on machine learning quickly.  If you want to learn by doing, this is the right book for you.Dislikes- The author does not always hold you hand through the whole journety.  You have to figure out certain things for yourself by looking at the example code which is available online.  As the title suggests, the book is for coders who know how to read code and put together pieces of code snippets to make the examples work (but don't worry, it's not that difficult).- The author does not spend a whole lot of time on explaining the details of fundamental AI/ML concepts.  Again, if your background is not in engineering/math/programming, you may find it hard to keep up.  You might want to learn the basic concepts elsewhere first.All in all, this is a good intro book on AI and machine learning, but you will most likely need supplemental material to have better understanding of what's in the book.

"This is a good book, and I would say an essential one to include in your library if you are a computer vision practitioner. But only if you think of it as a giant ""survey paper"" covering all of computer vision. It is NOT suitable as a textbook for those learning computer vision- much of the math is glossed over quickly, and for many fundamental algorithms you are referred to other papers and textbooks. This includes fundamental algorithms such as RANSAC, a fundamentally important one in computer vision, which is given an incomplete top-level summary (not enough to clarify what it is or enable one to attempt implementing it) and then referenced by several papers.It does have an extensive appendix section referencing numerous software packages and sample data sets that one can use to help learn the field. This is valuable.In short, this would be a good 3rd or 4th book to add to your CV library, but not your first! For this I rated it four stars above.

"Learning Tensorflow is a book about TensorFlow and it's a really good book. I'm surprised at some of the low ratings here on Amazon, and I think it's based on some misconceptions on what the book is about. This book isn't about deep learning (though there are some introductory chapters that introduce different types of neural networks (CNN, RNN, FC)), it's more about the faculties of TensorFlow as a deep learning framework. It's one of the few books (I've read a few books on Tensorflow already) that goes over the input pipeline using threading and queue, TFRecords as well as distributed computing with Tensorflow. These are very important aspects that are usually passed over in other Tensorflow -related books. The introductory chapters on Tensorflow graph basics are also well-done in my opinion. Of course, they could have added more materials -- I wish there was a stand alone chapter on Tensorflow slim and Tensorflow models which I believe are part of the tf framework now. I also wanted to see an auto-encoding, object detection chapter. However, the field is transforming very quickly as well as tf, so I think it's good they got the  book out.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learning TensorFlow: A Guide to Building Deep Learning Systems

"Learning TensorFlow: A Guide to Building Deep Learning Systems is exactly the book I was looking for.  At 228 pages (including the index), this is not a complete TensorFlow reference tome however.  You need to know what you are doing walking into this.  You at least need to know Python, but reasonable knowledge of computer science, machine learning, linear algebra, and statistics are almost expected.The goal of this book is to get you up and running with TensorFlow, so detailed installation help is offered.  You may have to google a thing or two, but this is good stuff and points you in the right direction at a minimum.  After you're up and running, the book gets you to pull the MNIST handwritten digits dataset for some machine learning and image processing.  So even before page 50 you are building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Python and TensorFlow.  There are enough descriptions and introductions to keep you motivated.Next, it's the CIFAR10 dataset.  Things begin to get more interesting with 32x32 resolution images of airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks!  You'll learn to train a Deep Neural Networks and build models on your laptop or home PC to recognize these images with around a 70% accuracy with TensorFlow.There are also dedicated chapters on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and working with text.  Now it's time to learn about Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for text sequences and supervised word embeddings.  There are plenty of code snippets available (under a rather generous license, I might add) to help you understand these concepts and the paradigms behind TensorFlow.  It's still handy to have google at your disposal, and perhaps a user forum to ask questions.  This is very doable, but the text goes quick.I appreciate that the higher level abstractions are saved for later in the book.  Once you've worked through CNNs and RNNs, the book introduces TFLearn and Keras for higher level abstraction.  You may appreciate it at this point.  And again, the book walks you through how to install these open source technologies.No modern Deep Learning book would be complete without a discussion of parallelization however.  The later chapters walk through examples of working with threads and clusters.  I particularly appreciate the how quickly the book gets to the point of parallelization.  What's the goal, where does it take place, and how do you do it.  You'll be replicating a computational graph across multiple cluster nodes before you know it (or at least using localhost:port# to mimic it).The book wraps up on how to save and export models that are created with TensorFlow.  This discussion is particularly relevant when considering how to commercialize your technology and work.  This is a very relevant and often overlooked topic.Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to get a better grasp of TensorFlow with plenty of solid code examples.  This isn't for everyone though, make sure you you have the basics down before you venture into this one.  Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning TensorFlow: A Guide to Building Deep Learning Systems
"Wishing to learn about TensorFlow, I decided to survey TF books available from Amazon, and pick one or two for further study.

The books by Karim, and by Zaccone and Karim, are out as a matter of principle, or of my personal distaste for plagiarism. Bonnin's book is, frankly, difficult to understand, so out it goes too. The idiosyncratic book by Hua and Azeem is better than the non-fake reviews on its page suggest, but is still an open-and-shut case.Out of Packt territory, and on to O'Reilly's ""Learning TensorFlow"".

"Caveat, I haven't actually /used/ this book yet. But, reading through it I'm so glad I bought it. I'm doing a Coursera Deep Learning course (uses TensorFlow) and we're all paying our dues, writing everything at low level. But through this I found that there are very nice higher-level frameworks built on TF (Keras, TFLearn, TF-Slim), which I expect I'll use in practice.This is a very lovely and helpful guide to TF; progressive examples, pointers to code, data, and models, and how to use TensorBoard. It includes pandas examples to let you make nice charts, too. You could probably get this book and play with Deep Learning and TF just fine, knowing nothing else - only if you go off the beaten track would you perhaps need more theory (or lore - there doesn't seem to be much Deep Learning theory).I was leery of buying it because one reviewer here said it was a dump of the online docs - I've owned books like that so I was prepared to believe it, but, this is absolutely not; it's so worth whatever it costs. And it's very nicely written, too, with language that's sharp, clear, and doesn't put your brain to microsleep like one other book I could mention.I may update this review if I find problems, but so far so it's very, very welcome. I'd give it 6 stars if it would give you pointers on getting TF running on Amazon or Google (that would be a good few pages probably, but for anything significant that's where you're going to do it. How about it for the second edition guys?).Oh - since books de-emphasize what version of software they were written against, this uses TensorFlow 1.1.

"This is by default the best book on H2O, since there aren't others. That said, the author makes a strange choice of splitting the book between Python and R code, particularly considering it is written for an audience that is not fluent in ML modelling. The beginning states that most will be in both languages, but sometimes there will only be Python code; this is not the case. There are huge chunks of R-only. At one point, he writes a bunch of code in R and says the Python equivalent is available on his Git. If it is, then it is named something quite different than the R code. The only way a book like this works is if all the code is available in both languages, and that is not the case.TL;DR: If you know both Python and R and don't mind splitting work in both while following along, this is a good book. Otherwise, just stick to H2O's booklets and documentation (after learning ML in your language if you don't already).",2.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Machine Learning with H2O: Powerful Scalable Techniques for Deep Learning and AI

"The term Artificial intelligence (AI) was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy at a workshop at Dartmouth College. AI and deep learning are the most rapidly evolving fields in our living, outsmarting Moore's law! To name a few, they affect our lives in the industry, transportation, communication, tourism, agriculture, education, retails, national security, and health care. This timely book edited by Stanley Cohen is the most current introduction to the field. Dr. Cohen has assembled a team of experts, and they have contributed to their respective areas of expertise. This book covers the specialty of diagnostic surgical pathology, chapters 1-5 provide a broad overview of the basic concepts and are techniques of AI that will be useful to anyone in biomedicine. The first two chapters by Dr. Cohen contain the fundamentals punctuated by his wit and wisdom (The machine will provide that a tomato is a fruit. The human will provide the wisdom that it does not belong in the fruit salad. Together they will determine that ketchup is not a smoothie). Additional write-ups expect the reader, besides medicine, to have some basic knowledge of high school and college math, but not a formal programming language. Each chapter ends with a useful summary/conclusion of the contents. I found the well-written chapter ""Digital pathology as a platform for primary diagnosis and augmentation via deep learning"" by Anil Parwani appropriate and comprehensive. The last chapter # 11 entitled ""Overview of the role of artificial intelligence in pathology: the computer as a pathology digital assistant"" by John Tomaszewski is the timeliest with cautious optimism. This in summary is a well-documented readable book on the field specifically applicable to the diagnostic anatomic pathology.Prabodh Gupta MD,Professor Emeritus Perelman School of Medicine,The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA .19104",5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning in Pathology

"Review:  Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning in Pathology.  Edited by Stanley Cohen, publisher:  Elsevier.Reviewer:  Barbara H. Zimmerman, Adjunct Professor Computing Sciences, Villanova University.Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning in Pathology is a must read for pathologists in practice or in training. With the development of Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) in the early 2000’s, the field has progressed into the potential for diagnostic assistance using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).Dr. Cohen and his co-authors have given us a very clear introduction to AI with deep learning and its many diverse algorithms as well as their applicability to pathologic diagnosis.  AI is at the forefront of many fields of endeavor. While many textbooks exist on these topics, Dr. Cohen’s book stands out by describing a difficult subject in an uncomplicated manner.  He takes us from a brief history of the field into the terminology and algorithms of the various AI models by using everyday language and without the usual complex formulas that discourage non-mathematicians.  Concepts such as the difference between shallow and deep learning are illustrated with simple yet complete descriptive terms and examples.  Excellent illustrations have been chosen to describe the various algorithms such as decision trees and clustering currently used in the field.  An explanation of advanced neural network with reinforcement learning illustrates the learning aspect of AI.  Other aspects of the field are also explained thoroughly, such as the need for preprocessing of data, feature engineering and dimension reduction.The field of AI is growing at an exponential rate and is applicable to many fields.  The practicing pathologist must understand the basics of AI and its application to pathology.  Dr. Cohen’s Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning in Pathology is an excellent primer into the field.  The book is highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning in Pathology

"Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are one of the most important Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods used today, and have replaced previous state of the art (SOTA) technologies for many applications such as Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing, and Image and Video Processing. Thus, it is essential for any AI practitioner to form a practical understanding of DNN and deep learning technology.Most modern deep learning innovations form out of a black-box type thinking - based on their intuitions about the problem at hand, researchers think of different ways of connecting together known modules, such as CNNs, LSTMS, or Transformers. Deep knowledge of the underlying mathematics is often not necessary, and it could be more of an art than a science when one designs a new model by connecting known modules. To realize their designs, people can use modern tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch; however this still requires one to be a competent programmer to use the APIs provided by these tools.KNIME removes this last barrier (of being a competent programmer) and makes it easy for anyone to enter the space of deep learning, through its graphical user interface (GUI) approach to build complex neural networks, which is visually aligned to the black-box way of thinking that one uses when designing a new network. One instantiates and connects modules in the GUI just the way one thinks about them. This enables easy and fast design and evaluation of complex neural networks for anyone, even if they do not have a programming or computer science background.This book, written by KNIME experts with deep knowledge in both KNIME and AI methods, promises to open up the space of deep learning to anyone who is interested, irrespective of their experience in programming. It will be of value both in the educational and industrial fields.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Codeless Deep Learning with KNIME: Build train and deploy various deep neural network architectures using KNIME Analytics Platform
"This title seemed interesting for two reasons : KNIME is one of the most respected software frameworks for Data Science projects and Deep Learning is one of the hottest Machine Learning techniques with many successful real-world applications.The important point to keep in mind is that the book is written for readers that do not know how to code. Because of this there are no examples for one important functionality of KNIME which is the use of a programming language such as Java, R or Python to pre-process and analyze data.The book walks the reader through KNIME and its key processes with many examples and content related to Deep Learning theory. After the reader learns about the basics of the KNIME framework and the theory of Deep Learning, several sections provide practical examples with the aim of putting everything together.Sections of the practical applications include Natural Language Processing, Image Analysis, Machine translation, Fraud Detection and Energy Demand Prediction.  For each application the authors provide information on the necessary steps of pre-processing, analyzing and testing. Finally, a special section is given for the Deployment phase of a project which is often not well explained in many Data Science books.The pros :1) Well-written book, explains key concepts and gives best practices2) Many practical applications provided3) Extensive information on Deployment options.The cons :1) I would prefer an example of Natural Language Processing such as Entity Detection (a technique that transforms unstructured data to a structured format) to be given instead of the Free text generation example2) Although the KNIME framework has so many of them, it would be nice if the authors simply mentioned -rather than fully explain due to limited space- more KNIME Nodes that are likely to be of use when it comes to accessing and pre-processing data. This addition could prove very useful since with programming a lot of pre-processing actions can be implemented and programming is not part of this book.Overall, a very useful and well-written book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Codeless Deep Learning with KNIME: Build train and deploy various deep neural network architectures using KNIME Analytics Platform
"This book makes deep learning accessible to anyone with little or no prior programming experience. The user-friendly GUI integrations to the open-source KNIME Analytics Platform are built on robust and powerful deep learning frameworks like Keras and TensorFlow. Leverage on the shoulder of giants who already developed the tool and dive straight into trying your hands on some case studies without the burden/barrier of code. The authors provide the right mix of theoretical foundation followed by practical case studies on fraud detection, natural language processing (NLP), image classification, etc. The last section (two dedicated chapters) covers usually neglected topics, like implementing trained models to production and a much-needed chapter on deployment best practices. The deployment options include a web app or a REST web-service again without any coding in no time; however, it requires access to a licensed version of the KNIME Server.To summarize, if you learn best by doing, you can't go wrong with this book. I recommend this to someone who wants to get started but may feel a little lost and anxious. You'll want to check out the book's companion workflows at KNIME Hub. It contains lots of workflows with configured nodes and data that you can run right on your computer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Codeless Deep Learning with KNIME: Build train and deploy various deep neural network architectures using KNIME Analytics Platform
"The strength of this book is that it breaks down complicated deep learning problems into manageable steps, so you can still do interesting research without a PhD in data science. The book does rely on one specific software program, the KNIME analytics platform. As someone in the speech recognition field, I was especially interested in the chapter about NLP (Natural Language Processing).This chapter gives you several very practical methods for doing sentiment analysis, novel text generation, and coming up with new company or product names.One of the most important things in any data science project is cleaning up the data--it's often the most time-consuming part, and this book clearly guides you through that process.The sample project that generates new fairy tales was interesting but given the output I'm not too worried about computers taking over all the authoring jobs any time soon.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Codeless Deep Learning with KNIME: Build train and deploy various deep neural network architectures using KNIME Analytics Platform
"Developing deep learning models is time demanding, and naturally difficult; the underlying techniques (architecture types) are fundamentally complex. It requires coding expertise.

"This book is an encyclopedia of artifical intelligence. Many parts of the book are only of interest, or of use, to particular audiences, for example, the math algorithm section could only be understood by math majors, and the discussion of medical specialty areas may only be of interest to those with that specialty.My main criticism of the book is that the reader , after reading the book, may wish to implement an AI system without understanding the associated problems. The author overemphasized solutions over problems. These problems include1. Big Data from medical records has problems which makes making medical decisions from it difficult.2. Not knowing how an AI system makes decisions may cause healthcare personnel to accept results when the input is flawed.3. AI used by a general audience may cause overtreatment.Point 1: Big Data from medical record has preliminary diagnoses, inconstent data, and may not have or properly recognize outcomes making medical decisions based on the data difficult. For more information, see the book, ""A Blueprint for Medicine.""Point 2 example: A machine I used at night to determine sleep apnea put a sensor on my chest. I accidently put my phone, playing music, on the sensor. Even told of this, the medical organization used the computer generated results anyway, as no one knew how to correct it.Point 3 example: Apple has a watch that looks for a Fibs.

"Dr. Parag Mahajan delivers an exhaustive reference work detailing the role of AI/Machine Learning/Deep Learning in medicine. AI has been around  and in use for some time already. Having a medical background I was already aware of some of these uses and had not always looked upon AI favorably. However, as giant technological advancements have been made, it truly is awe-inspiring to contemplate what a valuable tool it really is in being able to improve our lives and those of whom we serve. This book opened my eyes to the positive strides that have been made and will continue to be made.I loved the breakdown of various medical disciplines in Section 8 (but if it had been in alphabetical order I would've liked it better). Also, as many have commented on, looking at AI in view of the current pandemic is a great way to get a look at AI in practical application in terms we can relate to.Another great discussion was Section 6, Chapter 4 - AI in Medical Education. Unfortunately it seems to be the way of things that education is often the last arena to be brought up to speed. I'm glad to see the issue addressed here. Section 10 is yet another captivating section centering on specific corporations and their efforts into medical AI.Although so much information could quickly become overwhelming, Dr. Mahajan delivers it in such an engaging manner that is understandable. Neither was I lost in the information, nor did I feel it patronizing. I found myself not wanting to put it down!

"This is a comprehensive look at the changing face of medicine. Covid vastly increased the use of telemedicine. What most consumers don’t know is that the evolution of Artificial Intelligence is moving at a pace that might give patients and healthcare professionals whiplash if they attempt to study all of these developments individually. The author has packaged the current status of AI in Healthcare into a very accessible book. The terminology and techniques presented can be understood by the typical lay person. Having this resource will enable today’s patients to be informed when discussing their own health concerns with their doctor. More impressive to me is the pace of development of self-monitoring healthcare artificial intelligence that can be obtained through the internet and smart devices such as phones, watches, and other monitors.Because AI is increasingly used in making medical decisions, patients may become concerned about ethical decision making. This topic is included in the volume as well and the topics presented may be shocking to the reader(such as how the machine can learn bias through its algorithmic program and input of data).As frightening as AI in healthcare might seem, it has moved healthcare forward in a number of ways: diagnosis, monitoring, screening, surgical and treatment accuracy, drug and equitable development to name a few.During this post-Covid era, the section on the use of AI for screening, social distancing, and treatment development is particularly interesting.

"I'm not a doctor; I'm an artist. But Artificial Intelligence has come into the field of graphic design with a vengeance— Adobe, for instance, is constantly developing new features powered by the kind of iterative machine learning described here— and so this book caught my interest. It also helps that I have family members in the medical field (including one who is an engineer designing surgery robots).Whenever I read a non-fiction book I compare it to the excellent ""Lore of Running"" by Timothy Noakes, M.D., which is indeed a book about running— but it begins with a detailed discussion of energy transport in muscle cells and builds from there until it has covered every aspect of the topic: history, practical advice and a look toward the future.This book comes out very favorably in that comparison! Dr. Mahajan has covered the topic beginning with explanations of AI for laymen like me, carrying on through ethical concerns, mythbusting and finally a granular breakdown of the current and potential state of AI in every imaginable field from nutrition to veterinary medicine.

"Perrotta does a great job of gradually introducing each new layer of abstraction. Instead of expecting the reader to understand how to program and understand calculus algorithms from formulas alone, he provides examples which can be directly followed to build a working model. When you start to see each piece working by itself, it is easier to understand and appreciate what is going on inside the more complex networks. He also provides good visual diagrams which suppress irrelevant details to emphasize the main idea of each chapter section.Read the introductory pages under ""How the Heck Is That Possible?"" before committing to purchase. This book is not necessarily for someone who is already productive with ML libraries but who wants to reinvent them from scratch. Instead, the book provides an accessible and methodical progression through the essential concepts of how to build and use neural networks. Several tips and good practical advice are also provided to help beginners avoid common pitfalls--for example, data normalization and the separation of validation and testing. This book is an on-ramp which helps the beginner understand enough to get started and become productive--which will inevitably lead to using those popular programming libraries.When Parrotta starts to use a library to manage the larger network structures in the second half of the book, it feels earned rather than a confusing shortcut because he spent several chapters walking a beginner through the major parts of what the library will be doing.If you are an intermediate programmer who is interested in neural networks, check out this book--especially if you have found many of the online explanations and tutorials to be frustrating and opaque.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Machine Learning: From Coding to Deep Learning
"The author does a great job describing the details of machine learning from the ground up.The underlying math is clearly explained, and the accompanying Python is quite elegant.For the first two thirds of the book, there's no real dependency on any magic from libraries.Numpy is often the only imported library, and even then, the details of what numpy is doing are explained in the book.It covers a wide range of topics in ML as it builds up from simple line fitting program, through image recognition, and all the way up to a functioning deep neural network!The book is extremely well done in my opinion.Also, for those new to Python, there is a short introduction to it in Appendix I.It's a little hard for me to gauge it, since I already know Python, but it looks like a very good introduction to the language for existing programmers.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming Machine Learning: From Coding to Deep Learning

"Deep learning and associated connectionist approaches are now applied routinely in industry and academic research from image analysis to natural language processing and areas as cool as reinforcement learning. As practitioners, we use these techniques and utilise them from well designed and tested reliable libraries like Tensorflow or Pytorch as shipped black-boxed algorithms. However, most practitioners lack mathematical foundational knowledge and core algorithmic understanding. Unfortunately, many academic books and papers try to make an impression of superiority show subliminally and avoid a simple pedagogical approach. This unique book trying to fill this gap with a pedagogical approach to the mathematics of deep learning avoiding showing of mathematical complexity but aiming at conveying the understanding of how things work from the ground up.This little book archives so much with down to earth approach with introducing basic concepts with a respectful attitude, assuming the reader is very smart but inexperience in the field.

"While Python normally does the job just fine when it comes to handling ML and more general analytics tasks, I have wanted for a long time to work on these kinds of problems using C++.  Unfortunately, it has been very difficult to get started because of a severe lack of educational resources out there.  Luckily, this book has finally filled that gap for me.What I really like about the book is that the author has put together a series of very complete examples for each method being discussed.  Every program reads in an actual csv file with the data (as opposed to using some form of random number generation to create a toy example), puts it into the right format to be used with the given implementation of an ML method and then puts together a data set that one can use as output.  As someone who has not had much experience with C++ outside a classroom setting, I found this extremely helpful, and it has made the material immediately applicable to my work in real life.The book covers just the right amount of theory in each chapter as well before diving into the C++ implementation, making the material accessible to developers who are relatively new to data science (which, as I understand, is actually the main target audience).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands-On Machine Learning with C++: Build train and deploy end-to-end machine learning and deep learning pipelines

It has the same  mathematical introduction theory, but counters with a set of code libraries that work with C++.This book will allow the C++ programmer to expand his programming scope without having to rewrite his entire code base in Python and learn a whole new programming language.

"Disclaimer: The publisher asked me to review this book and gave me a review copy. I promise to be 100% honest in how I feel about this book, both the good and the less so.Personal Background: My first programming language after I started university was C++, followed by C. I'm glad to see that C++ can be used for ML problems, though I do understand that Python can be the easier choice. I try to keep in mind, however, that most if not all Python ML libraries are written in C/C++ to make it run faster.OverviewTo get the most out of this book, I would recommend that you have at least an intermediate competency of C++ and some basic knowledge of machine learning. The former is far more valuable than the later, in this case, as the author assumes that you know C++. There is no hand holding with the code. However, the author does walk you through ML from the basics to a moderate level.What I Like:This book is broken into four overall sections: Overview of Machine Learning, Machine Learning Algorithms, Advanced Examples, and Production and Deployment Challenges. This is an excellent selection of sections that make the overall book better organized. The first section gives a good overview of machine learning (as the title indicates), including a basic understanding of the math involved, data preproccessing, and general rundown of the considerations for choosing which ML technique you should use.The second section gives all the major ML algorithms that a junior ML developer will need. The book focuses on supervised and unsupervised ML, which is most of what you'll see in a business setting. This section finishes with a chapter on Ensemble Learning, where you use multiple ML algorithms to give you better results. The advanced examples mix and match some other algorithms to give you a basic understanding and a starting point for learning more. The final section looks at model deployment and mobile and cloud considerations. If you're new to machine learning and wish to use C++, this is a book book for it. Especially valuable are the Further Reading sections at the end of every chapter.What I Don't Like:When looking at the code, it was very different from the C++ code I learn nearly two decades ago. With the use of C++17, I faced a steep learning curve to use the code examples. While not a concern in and of itself, the first reference to C++17 I could find is on page 41. As someone who knows and enjoys an older version, this made using the code examples more difficult to me. I understand and agree with using a more recent version of the language, but would have appreciated a warning on the back cover or at least in the preface so that I could do some review first. A book recommendation for learning this version of C++ would have be appreciated as well.In the first chapter, the author divides machine learning up into two categories: supervised and unsupervised learning. While technically correct, there is a third category that doesn't fit well into either one: reinforcement learning. I wouldn't expect the author to delve into that niche sub field, it still should have been mentioned.What I Would Like to See:I really enjoyed this book. It has much to offer anyone with C++ experience. It is well organized and has much useful information. I am very happy to have it as part of my library. I think that a book from this author about C++ ML from Scratch would be interesting.Overall, I give this book a 4.9 out of 5. It's an excellent resource.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands-On Machine Learning with C++: Build train and deploy end-to-end machine learning and deep learning pipelines
"My background: I'm an expert software engineer (C++, Java, etc) and proud n00b at machine learning.  I've read the O'Reilly ""AI and Machine Learning for Coders"" book and many online articles. I have a background in trading/financial software, which exposed me to many statistical terms in this book. In the past, PhD level physics/math quants would typically handle those topics and this book has helped me realize some gaps in my knowledge and fill them (sometimes via online search).  I can now at least reason about those concepts better even if I don't yet understand the details.I'm 1/3 into the book (so maybe premature for 5 stars) and it's been a dense but interesting read so far.  There have been times where I have to lookup terms but the material has still been approachable.  The language in the first couple chapters could probably be simplified some but it was sufficient for me with a lot of coffee.  I expect to still have very incomplete knowledge after finishing this book due to lack of practical experience. However, my goal is to build a large scaffolding of knowledge/concepts on ML that I can use as a foundation for future learning and broaden my toolbox before I start hacking code.  When I was learning C++, I found the Gang of Four book ""Design Patterns"" accomplished a similar goal to help bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical software engineering.  Much like with the GoF book I suspect I may be re-reading parts of this book in the future when my knowledge has matured.  Some may prefer doing a lot of ML coding before reading this book, but I like to have a lot of background knowledge/tools before tackling code - personal preference I guess.I seem to have discovered an error/typo regarding ""precision"" vs ""recall"" in chapter 3:Page 135 paragraph 2: ""If we care more that our model is correct whenever it makes a positive class prediction we'd optimize our prediction threshold for recall"".I think the last word in that sentence should be ""precision"".

"About This BookThis book is the latest in a collection of attempts to teach aspiring and experience machine learning practitioners the mathematics underlying their field. Knowing this will help anyone truly understand how their algorithms work in more detail and can assist in strengthening their predictions or troubleshooting when the results don't match up.It begins with the basics of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics, moves on to optimization and graph theory, and then digs deeper into more specific mathematics. The second section takes the foundation and looks at different kinds of simpler neural networks. The final section pushes even further into deep learning and makes sure that the reader can explain why their deep learning models do what they do.Who is This For?From the Preface, this book is for anyone who wants to go from the basic mathematical concepts to the exact mathematical structures used in calculating the results for deep learning. It does not expect the reader to know the math, though it would be helpful, but it does expect the reader to know the basics of how machine learning works.With how difficult most people find mathematics, I know that many machine learning practitioners won't want to delve deep into these fundamentals, if they even are curious at all. But every field has a foundation, and I would argue that mathematics is that foundation for machine learning. After all, machine learning is fundamentally a mathematically transformation of the input to the output.Why Was This Written?There are only a handful of books written on this subject, of which I own most of them. Most focus only on the basics of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics. Another perspective on comparing these books is the approach taken. I can think of only one other book written specifically for the mathematics of deep learning, and that one assumes the reader thinks more like a mathematician. This book, instead, sees the reader as a developer with hands on experience who wants to know why their algorithms work. I feel that this is an important contribution to anyone's collection.OrganizationThree three section organization works well here. The author progresses from the basics to the core subject matter indicated by the title of the book without leaving anything important out. Remember, this book isn't about learning everything about these mathematical subjects, but about knowing enough to better understand deep learning. You're aren't going to focus on proving that the math works, but will trust that the math works and apply it.Within each chapter, the author deftly introduces each topic, builds on the subject from the basics up to the more advanced subtopics you should know about, and then gives a summary to refresh the earlier material and bring it all together. There is a complete preface, which I recommend you read through before starting, and a further reading section with other offerings from the publisher on deep learning.Did This Book Succeed?I think the author did very well. It gives the reader all of the mathematics they will need to progress on their machine learning and deep learning journeys. Where I think this book fell short, as it is written for practitioners, is that it could have expanded by another 100-150 pages and added in code to show how a programming language can efficiently calculate the math. This could help the reader write better code. If the author decides to write a second edition, I hope that they will consider this.Rating and Final ThoughtsI give this book a 5 out of 5. It is complete, readable, and helpful. It does what it says it is going to do very well. I commend the author and hope to see more from them. If you are considering buying this book, it is a good addition if you want to be a better machine learning practitioner.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands-On Mathematics for Deep Learning: Build a solid mathematical foundation for training efficient deep neural networks
"I have read many books on deep learning, and many of them talk about theory where it is beyond the reach of the average reader who doesn't have a strong math background of a MS in the sciences, or is about programming them in some language or library, but they very rarely break things down and explain them the way this book does. While the book may lack mathematical rigour and deep explanations and proofs, it makes a very good attempt at trying to simplify concepts to make them intuitive for readers who are trying to get into the field and don't come from a strong mathematical background. On the cover, the book claims to cover a breadth of topics but it seems to be focused on the main classes of neural networks (FNNs, CNNs, RNNs) and gives brief introductions to the other topics.

Explore their respective boundaries.Go beyond the straight-forward examples for each model type, and discuss how the package can be used towards some common changes when working with different models or data types at a more advanced level",4.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning with PyTorch Lightning: Swiftly build high-performance Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using Python
"I mainly use Keras for work and have not used Pytorch frequently but this book definitely is a good starting point for someone would like to know more about Pytorch Lightning. Couple reasons why I like this book: (1) there are a lot of explanation for why the code is written and structure this way. So if you don’t have a very strong python background, you shall be able to get through this book without breaking a sweat.  (2) it covers a wide range of applications, including CNN for image recognition, LSTM for time-series, as well as model deployment using Flask. A nice introduction to this relatively new framework.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning with PyTorch Lightning: Swiftly build high-performance Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using Python
"I really enjoyed this book. I have wanted to learn more about “pytorch lightning” for a while since it is becoming one of the main wrappers around pytorch, and this book made this learning process enjoyable. I think the author did a great job creating content for deep learning practitioners with different levels of understanding. This can be exceptionally challenging, some authors get lost deep into fundamentals of deep learning, others expect an advanced vocabulary that hurts the learning process, but I found Kunal Sawarkar did a nice job keeping it interesting and packed full of information.The book also covers a nice array of content with interesting data sets. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking to learn more about pytorch lighting. In particular I really like the speech recognition using flash, how he set up and talked about the traffic forecasting/time series problem. I also enjoyed reading and learning about GANs but I still feel that it is going to be a while before they become useful. Image captioning and contrastive learning are really interesting, and I will definitely try them out in “pytorch lighting”. It was also nice to see how easy it is to convert ""Pytorch Lighting"" models to ONNX format and server them with a flask app, I would have liked to see the same process for an NLP model.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Learning with PyTorch Lightning: Swiftly build high-performance Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using Python

"Disclaimer: The publisher reached out to me to review this book and has given me a review copy to do so. However, I promise to be 100% honest and completely forthcoming in my review of this book.Overview:This book is designed for people who have some knowledge and/or experience in the AI & Machine Learning space. The book specifically mentions data scientists, deep learning engineers and researchers, and AI developers as the target audience. As such, it's recommended that you have at least a basic understanding of College Level Mathematics, particularly Linear Algebra and Statistics. In addition, all of the programming examples in this book are in Python, so I would recommend having some knowledge in that; however, if you are experienced in other programming languages this isn't a strict requirement as Python is relatively easy to learn.What I liked:I think introduction/refresher section in the first chapter was very well done! Coming from someone who has knowledge of both Linear Algebra and Statistics but hasn't used them in a while, the examples, definitions, and provided diagrams were not only very clear, but they also simple enough for me to remember some steps or details that I had originally forgotten. This is also simple enough for those who aren't very strong in Mathematics to get a basic idea of the formulas they will be using and their purpose.I also appreciated the fact that while the code examples were accessible outside of the book, that many of the important ones and their purpose were present in and explained in the book. In addition to this, these examples were very practical and were backed up and explained with various math concepts. That combined with the ""Put it together"" sections at the end of each chapter helped me learn and remember many of these concepts.What I Don't Like:There honestly isn't much that I didn't like, the only thing I would suggest is possibly going a little bit more in depth as to advantages and disadvantages of certain techniques. But honestly thats the only thing I could think of and it didn't really take away from the experience of the book.Final Thoughts:Overall I think this book is a fantastic read for those who want to learn more about command deep learning strategies and techniques as well as the math behind it. If you don't have knowledge of Statistics and Linear algebra, I would suggest gaining a basic understanding of those prior reading this book.This is most certainly not a book for beginners and its not the type of book where you can read a section once and say you've ""mastered"" this topic. With that being said, if you meet the pre-requisites that I have mentioned before, then I would definitely read this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Advanced Deep Learning with Python: Design and implement advanced next-generation AI solutions using TensorFlow and PyTorch
"Advanced Deep Learning with Python (ADLP) is a heavyweight book: 450+ pages, no fluff. The author starts by reviving memories of at least 4 college courses — linear algebra, introduction to statistics, information theory, and differential calculus — before diving into the world of neural networks. If math scares you, this isn’t your book; all of that’s covered in the first 60 pages!Section 2 covers the broad topic of computer vision, again starting from the mathematical perspective of convolutional networks, then dropping into the “real world” applications of object detection, image processing, and modeling using neural networking techniques. The formulae and mechanical derivations are accompanied by a good number of charts and photograph processing samples which help the reader grasp the concepts under discussion.If you’re into language processing, you’ll find Section 3 of interest. This section provides an exhaustive examination of transformers, memory/learning algorithms, decoders, training, and recursive neural networks before presenting the example of Bidirectional encoder representations from transforms (BERT) and similar language models, best known for their applications at large-scale lookup / translation engines.The final section of the book covers emergent network design including new convolution and encoding practices as well as Neural Turing Machines. Attention is also given to machine meta-learning (“learning to learn”). Finally, a chapter on autonomous vehicle technology ties together many of the concepts the book has presented.This isn’t a particularly Python-specific book. Libraries and usage are discussed, but you won’t find tons of heavily commented sample code here. On the one hand, that keeps things generic enough that it’s useful for folks who aren’t Pythonistas; on the other hand, ADLP is not an implementation guide for Python NN development.ADLP is not for the beginner, nor for the casual reader, but if you’re looking for an in-depth treatment of deep learning and neural networking theory, this book is both readable and informative. I believe it’d make a great addition to the intermediate/advanced machine learning engineer’s bookshelf.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Advanced Deep Learning with Python: Design and implement advanced next-generation AI solutions using TensorFlow and PyTorch
"Disclaimer:  The publisher reached out to me to review the book and provided me a copy of it.This book is for readers who already know about DL and want to know the latest in applying DL.  This book covers a lot of breadth (vision, text, graphs, meta learning and autonomous vehicles) and depth in some topics (various vision and text neural network architectures). Book starts with an introduction to algebra, vector operations and calculus needed to understand DL concepts  in chapter 1 and then ramps up to cover DL applications from chapter 2 onwards. I feel this book is  good starting source for someone to get familiar with concepts of applying to DL to graphs and meta learning(there are abundant sources to learn about vision and text problems)If you are looking to learn from the basics, I recommend ‘deep learning’ Coursera course before buying this book.If you are looking to learn about PyTorch and Tensorflow frameworks (even though the title mentions them), I recommend you to look elsewhere.Final thoughts:Highly recommend for readers who are familiar with DL",4.0 out of 5 stars,Advanced Deep Learning with Python: Design and implement advanced next-generation AI solutions using TensorFlow and PyTorch
"Target audience for this book is : people who have basic knowledge of AI & Machine Learning.Topics which are perquisites:Basic Linear AlgebraStatisticsPython ( Not a hard requirement, but recommended)Pros:* If you are someone who doesn't remember, first chapter will make life easy for you. It has very thorough examples of each topic of Linear Algebra and statistics.* All the code implemented in the book are accessible via github which is very convenient to hands on on different datasets. I would recommend to run same code on different datasets to try it on your own.* ""Put it together"" is really nice way to revise all the topics learnt in the chapter.* All the chapters are mostly independent so if you want to focus on one topic than you can just read that chapter and grasp everything.* Personally, I really enjoyed section on text classification and BERT.Cons:* Code maybe hard for the ones who are not fluent in python but python is overall is easier to learn so I don't think this as a barrier to read this book.Overall, this book is really good read for the one who already have beginner level knowledge.

First initial chapters were good.  Code examples from GitHub link worked with only a minor issue or two.Later chapters all down hill - code examples did not work without major issues.  It looks like these chapters pulled from posts that the author has made - kind of looks like he just grabbed some stuff and stuck it into a GitHub.Very confusing that the GitHub has a different book title and I don't see the authors name on the site.  Started to wonder if the book was a heavy copy and paste.Anyway - loved the first 4 chapters - got lots of useful tricks.  NEVER got the code to completely run on any of the following chapters.One of the big issues for me when forking code to my local machines is that the directory references always need some work.  When files are completely missing from the chapters I spend a lot of time thinking it's me and a need to fix the directory - really makes me upset to see that the reference file was never included.  When authors of books leave out or really make some huge directory assumptions than its clear the book is not very well thought out - books for beginners ?,1.0 out of 5 stars,Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning: Creating and Deploying Deep Learning Applications
"I actually thought the book was a very good introduction to Pytorch and a good introduction to neural networks at a high level. Although this book is certainly not exhaustive on the latter front, it's not what it set out to do (in other words, don't look at this as a primer on deep learning). My background was heavily focused on TF and Keras. Given the recent advancement of Pytorch, I wanted to see what all the hype was about. The introduction to in the book Pytorch was smooth, slowly introducing newer topics and more difficult topics each chapter. I also like the way the author went from images, to NLP, to speech as IMO, that's probably the ramp up from easiest to hardest topic-wise. He also gives you some additional content on Pytorch in production and some pitfalls that you may experience while using it. Overall, I liked the book and think it gave me a good start to using Pytorch. There's no book that could really prepare you for the intricacies of a language like this; however, the book gives you a solid foundation to stand on.As for the code not working, I would ask the person above to just email the author as he does have the code up on a Github repo.

"If you know how to program in Matlab but know nothing about machine or deep learning, then this is the perfect book for you.  It’s very clearly written and goes through all the important topics with examples.  Every major topic has associated with it a complete and functioning Matlab program (not bits and pieces of a program that you’d have to figure out on your own).  It is concise and readable.  I hope the author considers writing a similar book on reinforcement learning.  I should add that I purchased this book through my work, so it doesn’t show here as verified purchase on my personal account.  But this is a terrific book and I would highly recommend it.  I purchased this book together with another one on “Matlab machine learning recipes” by another author.  That book which from its table of contents looked really promising turned out to be awful, but this one is great.A few notes to the author for the next edition:1) At least on my version of Matlab, functions don’t need an “end” in the program (e.g., p. 39 DeltaSGD). It crashes when I use an “end”, but works perfectly without it. This may be a remnant of extracting your examples functions from a larger script?2) p. 64 TestBackpropXOR program.  Why use three columns for input vector? The problem requires only two and the network works perfectly with only two columns.3) p. 86, where you are summarizing the steps, shouldn’t step 4 be delta = e instead of d=e?4) p. 122, section on “Architecture of ConvNet”, paragraph that starts with “Before ConvNet, the feature extractor has been designed”.  This should be “had been designed”.5) The TestDeepDrop out program in chapter 5 doesn’t really work well.  Maybe 1 out of 20 times you get the correct digit picked. I know the book says it’s just for demo of the technique, but it would be nice if it consistently picked the right category. There’s also no explanation why the sigmoid was used instead of ReLU here. It was strange to switch without explanation.Looking forward for more Matlab books from this author!",5.0 out of 5 stars,MATLAB Deep Learning: With Machine Learning Neural Networks and Artificial Intelligence

"I am hoping this book earns five stars, and will come back and update this rating if the typo I found on day one is an aberration. I ordered this book back in May and was very pleased to get it; so far it is excellent and exactly at the level I need: I am a sometime practitioner of machine learning and AI using a range of open source and off-the-shelf tools. I have moved more strongly into Python as i mostly deal with text and NLTK and python have bee easier / faster for me to pick up and use than java-syntric approaches. So moving into deep learning is a big step but I feel I am well prepared, and the level and degree of ""refreshers"" here, from linear algebra tp statistics are hitting just the right depth and tone.I initially thought my Kindle software was broken when searching for the first occurrence of ""SGD"" didn't show up; I remembered it was referred to as the ""canonical"" solution to solving a system of linear in an iterative fashion, but forgot what it stood for. Sure enough, right there on page 15 you find ""The canonical example of iterative methods most commonly seen in machine learning today is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SDG), which we discuss later in this chapter."".  I spent far too longing cross checking my paper book, my kindle reader (mac software) and notes before ""seeing"" the ""SDG"" was not ""SGD""... so i will give a full five stars if this is a rare occurrence.

"Have you been following the Artificial Intelligence in computing fad for the last decade or so? I have since I designed an AI based medical device to regulate human blood pressure in the ICU and received FDA approval for my design to be used in the US. I wanted to know what others were doing in applying AI in various computing categories and which ones were similar to natural neural networks in mammalian brains. But the literature was too scattered and apparently incomparable to make sense in general to be useful.Well, this is the book we've been looking for and it's about time! This is the gateway book to almost all of the methodologies used in developing AI computing. I still uniquely own the knowledge of developing AI by expert system design. But, in 500 pages this book covers the introduction to deep learning, fundamentals, architectures, concepts and models, tuning, data vectorization, and Spark data reduction with Hadoop. I found more areas of AI being uncovered here than I knew existed. What a bonanza!Designers are all much richer now that we can incorporate these AI approaches into our thinking. Buy the book and become an AI expert overnight. There is just one caveat, you will have to buy additional references to get to the deep details of the learning process in each category.

I have hundreds of papers and books on Neural Nets from the time of Rosenblatt's Perceptron on through autoencoders, recurrent NNs, convolutional NNs, RBM's, DNN's, greedy pretraining, Kolmogrov's universal approximation theorem, optimization methods for weight training, and more.I found this book to provide a conceptual overview of the DNNs and the architectures (feed forward, deep belief, unsupervised pre-trained, convolutional, recurrent, long and short term memory, and recursive, networks).  The book provides the conceptual connective tissue that are the muscles that the practitioner must bond to the architectural bones to move forward in Deep Learning.  The book is a remarkable debrief by two lead developers of the DL4J framework; Josh Patterson and Adam Gibson.  Every chapter offers new nuggets about how to apply their framework to real world ML problems, and about real world ML problems.The ending chapters are about the actual application of the DL4j framework to practical problems, and how to use the framework with DL4j with Spark, the ND4J API, using GPU's, distributed training, and trouble shooting.Unlike most books, many of which I buy for reference purposes to find what I need at various times, I am reading this one page-by-page to pick up all of the insightful observations.

"I am new to deep learning, I bought 2 books before this one and they were well written and explain things in  simple and clear ways.I was able to follow the examples in the books and implement them.I am not sure who this book is targeting.The first few theoretical chapters are definitely very confusing for someone who is a beginner and I feel if you are an expert they tell you that you don't have to read them.As for the code is very convoluted. They just put the whole code and then explain it like ""this line does that, this line does this, etc..""There is no clear explanation as to how/why they chose this design, this number of layers, etc..They lost me after the forth chapter.If you're a beginner then I don't think this book is for you.

First example, third line:module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'Session'because, Session isn't in tensorflow 1.X.So, to run ANY examples, you have to downgrade to old software, which is a huge pain. And even if you do, no one write anything now with tensorflow 1.X.So, this book is really completely irrelevant to anything anyone wants to so in 2021 in tensorflow.

"I can highly recommend this second edition of the book ""Deep Reinforcement Learning with Python"". The book gives a good introduction of reinforcement learning for practitioners and researchers. It is updated with Tensorflow 2.0, OpenAI Gym and Stable Baselines training and examples.  The book is enjoyable to read, with nice illustrations and it explains why certain concepts are introduced, rather than just throwing math equations at the reader. For example, the expected return value is explain in simpler terms using the weighted average of a small discrete distribution, before going into more abstract notation and concepts.The second chapter introduces OpenAI Gym, helps installing it on your computer and shows a few simple self-contained examples how to create your own Gym environment from scratch. Chapter 3 introduces the Bellman equation, Q function value and policy iteration, applied to the Gym environments created in the 2nd chapter for better intuition.It also shows how to use popular Gym environments with Atari games, Box 2D and MuJoCo. Note that you can replace MuJoCo by the open source PyBullet environments, it is integrated with Stable Baselines and the Baselines Zoo has pre-trained policies for PyBullet environments such as Walker2D, HalfCheetah, Ant, Reacher, Hopper, Humanoid, Minitaur robot and more. Chapter 7 shows how to build a neural network from scratch with forward and back-propagation of the gradients using pure Numpy, which gives a better intuition than just using existing large frameworks such as Tensorflow and PyTorch. Chapter 8 is a good introduction to Tensorflow, again with hands-on code and updated examples for the latest version of TF2 and Keras.The later chapters 9-13 discusses algorithms that our robotics research group uses, such as PPO and SAC (soft actor critic). Chapter 16 goes in detail on the popular implementation of such algorithms using the open source Stable Baselines, we also use for our recent motion imitation research.Each chapter finishes with questions and further reading material, it makes it suitable for self-study or (under)graduate classroom material.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Reinforcement Learning with Python: Master classic RL deep RL distributional RL inverse RL and more with OpenAI Gym and TensorFlow 2nd Edition

"This could be a great introductory book on reinforcement learning for both students and professionals. It has a great mix of theory, examples, and implementations of RL algorithms. The flow of concepts is gradual, starting from basic RL concepts like MDPs, Monte Carlo, Q Learning, and moves to Deep RL and a few advanced concepts towards the later chapters like model-based RL, imitation learning, etc. Another positive note is the use of TensorFlow 2.0 in this book which is much easier to understand than its previous versions.While many RL algorithms are covered, the book does miss out on topics like multi-agent reinforcement learning, reward shaping, and hyperparameter selection and tuning. One area of improvement could be to split this book into basic and advanced versions. This might improve engagement from either group (just a suggestion, 700 pages may be too long for some readers)!Overall, I thought the book is a great read.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Reinforcement Learning with Python: Master classic RL deep RL distributional RL inverse RL and more with OpenAI Gym and TensorFlow 2nd Edition
"I have read the first edition of this book. Compared to the first edition, this one is unbelievably good with extreme details. What I see is this edition seems to be completely rewritten with a very detailed explanation. I couldn’t find anything similar to first edition much. Author has included a section called math essentials before every algorithm and this helps to understand the underlying math behind RL algorithms in a very easy way. Next what I like the most is the flow of concepts and how they are interconnected.Right from very basic Q learning to advanced algorithms like PPO, ACKTR, GAIL, categorical DQN, max entropy inverse RL, this book covers everything with special importance given to math. I also liked how the code is very clearly explained with line by line explanation. Line by line code explanation I haven’t seen anywhere.

"I started reading this book to catch up on the latest in RL. I had taken some grad school courses on RL during my CS Masters and found the subject fascinating so I thought I’d check this out. To me, the theory was ok but the hard part about this book is that the “why” feels like it’s never explained. A blackjack example is given which seems fun to see how that would work but then, many choices are never explained and the “optimal policy” is severely dumbed down - optimal blackjack policy is to stay on 19 and up and hit otherwise, really? Why is that what you chose to be a starting point and how can you call that optimal? It’s not even mentioned that blackjack is far more complicated than you get to just hit or stay… frustrating to use an example and not at least say this is a trivial example.It feels like most examples are this way though, the “why” just isn’t explained aside from saying something along the lines of “because of the value function equation in 3.4.2, we do this”.I got through about 200 pages and had to put it down, I wasn’t absorbing anything theory, application, or otherwise.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Deep Reinforcement Learning with Python: Master classic RL deep RL distributional RL inverse RL and more with OpenAI Gym and TensorFlow 2nd Edition

"This book is excellent for the following demographic:People who already have a decent level of skill and experience in statistics who want to: - 1) Elevate their understanding of ML techniques without absolutely breaking their skull on dense theory - 2) Learn how to implement the algorithms in Python and gain moderate proficiency in sci-kit learnI would say it's not a beginner's book, but more for intermediates. I am half-way through and find it a little challenging, but definitely attainable. This balance I consider to be putting me right in the sweet spot for learning. To  judge whether you're a good candidate for this book, you can compare your experience and skill to me :I started this book after earning a PhD in the social sciences, which basically gave me good coverage in inferential and applied statistics (T, F distributions, p-values, confidence intervals, linear regression, one-way and factorial ANOVA, PCA, etc.). I also took a machine learning graduate course at my university and a few online courses in introductory ML for R. All of this background gave me solid grounding in statistics. With all this I still find this book somewhat challenging, but definitely not too hard. I'd say without my background I would find this book hard to get through. There is linear algebra, concepts like minimizing cost functions, bias/variance tradeoff, learning from errors, etc. So, if you are just starting out or reading the previous sentence and don't know what I'm talking about, I would recommend learning more stats fundamentals before starting this.After you gain some proficiency in stats, come learn this book and elevate your understanding of the algorithms, add nuance to them, integrate them into your mental conceptual structures more fully (e.g. you'll know more nuances of ML, e.g. which subsets of algorithms are preferred for controlling more of the bias, variance, how random forest is basically bagging with a twist, how adaboost's treatment of classification errors has kind of an element of perceptron implementation, and many more).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning - Second Edition: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python scikit-learn and TensorFlow
"This book will stay on your reference shelf for years to come!The authors clearly have taught these materials many times before, and their significant mathematical and technical prowess is delivered using a very approachable style.  This book seems best suited for someone who wants to sit down and begin to apply Python Machine Learning to a problem that they already know they have.  It's not particularly an ""intro course to M.L."", but it contains enough details that you could easily follow along and learn how to use the various tools and techniques of the field if you've never seen or heard of them before.The copious notes scattered throughout this book are pure gold, mined from the obvious experiences of the authors while working in the field.  If there ever is a Machine Learning equivalent to the venerable ""Forrest M.

Very steep learning curve.I almost gave up in chapter two at perceptron but since that algorithm is the foundation of all I spent a whole week to understand it. The code the author uses is pretty much optimized and it was not in sync with the mathematical introduction. But the first 30 pages are absolutely neccessary to read and understand deeply in order to move on.After page 30 it became a little faster to proceed with the book since topics from page 30 - 107 are mostly the extension of the perceptron. At page 107- 160 I am already accustomedto the authors style and to the books logic so it is now quite effective to read and digest the models.And that is where I am at the moment. I gave this book 5 stars since I wanted a high quality ML and python book which leads me through the models in a step-by-step way no matter how hard it is mathematically or programmtechnically.

"(I own the 1st edition, and was given early access to a pre-release PDF of the 2nd ed. My paperback copy just arrived.)This is the best book I've seen for professional software engineers to bootstrap themselves into Data Science, Machine Learning and (with the 2nd ed) Deep Learning. It makes heavy use of the scikit-learn library; and the latter chapters give an excellent high-level overview of TensorFlow. Books in this space can often feel either too basic or too academic. Not this one -- for me it hits the sweet spot of explaining and doing.What I love about Raschka's writing is how he builds up from theory to practical code. It lays out the concepts, math, and code together which helps comprehension. So, if you happen to be rusty in math, like me, you can look to the code to help explain what the equations actually do. The chapters of the book build up from each other; so many of the examples feel like they can be used as recipes for building your own custom models.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning - Second Edition: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python scikit-learn and TensorFlow

This is a nice way to reduce the complexity of explanation and getting lost in the details of the mathematics and programming syntax etc and to get at the heart of where different algorithms have strengths.This is review is from the perspective of someone who knows a little python and had little knowledge of machine learning, but has kind of seen neural nets and regressions used in different applications over the years.Part of its usefulness to me is that it gives me a nice way to explain machine learning to non-scientists.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning - Second Edition: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python scikit-learn and TensorFlow

B/W book. I thought it will be color printed,4.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists
"Update: Geron's book is much longer than this one (856 pages vs 400) and almost two-thirds of Geron's is about deep learning. This review is comparing this book to the first third of Geron's book. This book only provides several pages on deep learning (neural nets), similar to the other models. I would suggest this book for a basic foundation and if you want to dig into the minutiae of deep learning read the last 430 pages of Geron.I read the Geron book ""Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn & TensorFlow"" before reading this book. This book provides a better start for several reasons. First, it is better organized. Second, the code implementations rely primarily on Python modules, instead of custom programming.Regarding the first, this book is set-up so that a reader can get an understanding of Machine Learning (ML) step-by-step from the bottom-up. For instance, supervised learning, feature engineering, and model evaluation all get separate chapters. The model evaluation chapter provides an entire section, as well as graphics, for understanding the roles of training, validation, and test data, which are probably the most important bedrock concepts in ML. In contrast to this, Geron throws you right into an entire ML pipeline in the second chapter. It's a mix of feature engineering, linear models, stochastic gradient descent, random forest models, cross-validation, grid search, and even object oriented programming for custom transformers! This might be useful for quickly understanding what ML is like in practice. If later sections of Geron then went step-by-step and elaborated on the second chapter, it would be great. Instead, for instance, the second chapter is randomly about binary classification for image data. You only get two paragraphs in the first chapter on cross-validation and validation sets, and a sentence or two later in the book. I had to go to Wikipedia to ensure that I understood it correctly and robustly. I wish I had read this book instead.Regarding the second, this book does not assume a heavy programming background. Most of the ML pipeline is taught through the Python module Scikit-Learn. This is useful because the programming does not distract from learning fundamentals of ML. In contrast, in the second chapter of Geron, there is object oriented programming code involving concepts like constructors and inheritance. For this book, the most sophisticated chapter at the end, which is on pipelines and which expertly explains why feature engineering should be performed during model evaluation, doesn't even go into this. Some reviews mention that the author uses an mglearn Python package that he wrote. It is true that when he uses functions from this package the code is concealed. Arguably, this prevents readers who aren't familiar with Python from getting distracted by code that is unrelated to machine learning (such as creating visualizations). At times I was curious about how some of the code was working in the background (it is all available on GitHub), but the book's job is not to cover all aspects of data analysis with Python (which would be a separate book).In summary Geron teaches more advanced topics interspersed with the basics without an entirely coherent organizational structure. This book has an intuitive structure that elaborates at length on core ML concepts. It doesn't overburden with code, but may leave computer scientists wanting a bit more.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists
"This is a great book, and I'd say it is even great for those that are not familiar with python (you just obviously won't be able to run the code). For anyone with some basic understanding of linear algebra/statistics, the authors are able to present to you all the important (and sometimes subtle but significant) details, without the usage of equations, and more importantly, how they all relate to one another.All the concepts mentioned here are heavily backed with well thought of and well presented figures, in such a way that again I'd suggest you don't even need python to understand. If you do know python, loading the data sets and reproducing the figures is just a few lines of easy to understand code away (with the exception of the mglearn library includes which does some ""plotting magic"" for you. However, I believe each of them were appropriate. You can ignore them and make the plots in your own way, or just print the variables, it just may not look as publication friendly).Normally, I hesitate purchasing books that claim they may explain algorithms without the need of equations, and I expect them rather to be cook books of lightly and disjointly explained techniques (like an encyclopedia). However, I do not think such is true of this book. The power of scikit-learn is demonstrated and the algorithms behind them explained intuitively, and are referred as to how they fit together and complement each other.As with any introductory read, a supplement is needed from time to time and the authors' reference to Elements of Statistical Learning is a useful one (equation heavy). There are points in the book where the author defers to elements of statistical learning. I found these points suitable since further explanation would be out of scope.I read this book on my free time while on vacation, and much of the time I didn't have access to a computer. The concepts were so well presented that it was just a nice leisurely read. When I finally had time to access a computer, I was able to try the techniques on my data sets with some browsing back and forth through the book again, but otherwise with little effort.Finally, since I myself am a researcher, I would recommend this book to any other researcher willing to start delving into the world of machine learning. Further reading will always be necessary, but this book will give you such a good intuitive understanding and overview of the subject matter that you'll know what to do to proceed next, and how to do it without running in circles. Even better, you'll likely already have applied it to your research!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists
"I started determined to go through all the code samples in this book.The book starts with only four sentences about the Jupyter notebook although is the main environment for the whole book. The first code sample shown starts on line two of a cell, and it was very strange there was no line one. I was wondering if there was some type of misprinting.The code as printed is broken on page 10 where there is a line with 'display(data_pandas)'. This line gave me an error that display was unrecognized. I thought maybe this was a built-in Jupyter function so I went online to search. Eventually, I had to go to the author's GitHub and ask about this problem where I was told that he simply forgot to include 'from IPython.display import display'. It was a surprising admission because he did not say there was a misprint or mistake, but simply that he forgot to do that. It is very obvious there were zero technical reviewers for this book, because they would have also noticed the broken code right away.On page 11 we are introduced to a library called 'mglearn' which is a utility function that authors say they wrote for the book. Strangely, this repository has 733 stars on GitHub so it is obvious the library is not just for the book. Then in chapter two the author has tons of calls to mglearn which take in multiple parameters. The parameters are never explained and you have to go to the author's GitHub to see what the code actually does. In the 2nd chapter multiple of these mglearn calls broke for me. One seemed to be a conflict with numpy, and another I never figured out. I went to look at dicussions on mglearn to discover it is still a work in progress and there were sections where somebody was notifying the author that something was broken, and the author replying that he would look at it soon.The second chapter has 120 cell entries for supervised learning techniques. Each cell has roughly 5-10 lines of code, so there are nearly 1000 lines of code for the second chapter and they are all tossed into one gigantic Jupyter notebook. Explanations are very weak often defaulting to a brief description followed by code and then more code. Function calls and parameters are rarely explained at all.The last chapter is about natural language processing which is the machine learning subject I am most familiar with. Terms are often introduced with zero effort to define them, and it is assumed you already know many of the concepts. TF-IDF barely had any explanation at all, except to show the forumla for it. You can find much better explanations online.For a book which is so heavy on code and light on explanations, it is unacceptable that the code is broken.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists

Finally at the end is a single real life example involving product recommendations.  You can look at this web page to see the state of the art there.After reading 260 pages of this book, I gave up with the sneaking suspicion that machine learning is an academic fad that will run its course in a year or two.

"This book by Dr Logan Song shows his years of experience and ability to communicate that information in easier-to-understand terms. The book contains information about – GCP, a world leader in cloud computing and especially a leader in cloud ML. It also talks about machine learning in great detail, all the way from introduction to what ML means exactly, to algorithms and packages used in Python.In 2022, with the world of data being as complex and huge as it is, more and more companies are shifting to cloud based data storage. So it becomes mandatory to understand cloud platforms and how ML integrates into them. This book gives us a perfect idea of the same and allows the reader to be immersed in, and eventually develop the skillset to pursue a career in this field, WITHOUT ANY PRIOR KNOWLEDGE!I will review this book by the 3 parts it is divided into –Part 1 Starting with GCP and PythonChapter 1 talks about the Google Cloud platform itself. It gives a detailed understanding of what each aspect means, from buckets to virtual machines and databases. It helps the reader understand how cloud platforms work in general. Chapter 2 talks about Python, one of the most popular and easy programming languages used in the world today. Although it gives a basic idea of the language itself, while talking about the packages used commonly in the world of data (Pandas, Matplotlib etc) it falls short in explaining exactly how important building blocks they are for more advanced coding and packages such as Tensorflow and scikit-learn.Part 2 Introduction to Machine LearningChapter 3-5 dive deeply into the world of machine learning itself, explaining clearly what ML is, how it works (using Python) and how it transforms the industry. Understanding different models, their advantages and disadvantages is very important in ML. The book does a great job of talking about these concepts, while making sure they are understandable for beginners. However, while the book explains the concepts well, it lacks a bit in the coding aspect, with not enough examples.Part 3 Mastering ML and GCPChapters 6-9 now combine the knowledge gained from the first 2 parts – we now know how GCP works and how ML works, and now its time to make them come together. This part includes an introduction to Tensorflow and Keras, two pivotal and very important libraries used very widely in the data world today. The further chapters talk about Google Cloud Vertex AI and ML APIs, which are the interfaces for ML applications in GCP. While the concepts are explained beautifully with diagrams, there are not enough screenshots or code snippets for the reader to really relate the theory with the practical application.One of the best things about this book is a question bank for the GCP ML certification. This certification from Google is one of the best ways for employers to see that candidates have the required information to get a job in cloud and be successful in the industry. 30 practice questions in this book are not only in the similar format as the questions in the certification exam, but also are very good in terms of recapping the concepts learnt in the book.Overall, the book is amazing as an introduction, explaining the concepts well, but lacks in the ability to translate the conceptual to practical. A few more visual descriptions and examples would make this book the perfect tool for a beginner to become a certified Cloud and Machine Learning professional!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Journey to Become a Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineer: Build the mind and hand of a Google Certified ML professional

"This book is one of the best course books I have come across in my academics. It has become my go-to book for learning concepts and preparing for interviews. This book is an excellent source for those with a fundamental knowledge of Machine Learning (ML), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Python. This book covers a comprehensive outlook of four major parts: Starting with GCP and Python, Introducing ML, Mastering ML in GCP, and Accomplishing GCP ML Certification.At the book's onset, Dr. Long introduced the building blocks of both GCP and Python concepts. For a novice reader, as I am in Machine Learning, It really helped me brush up the concepts such as GCE, IAM, GCP storage and database, GCP Network(VPC), and the introduction of GCP big data and analytics and artificial intelligence. These are the concepts that I had the great pleasure of learning from the legend himself, Dr. Long. After building the great foundation, part 2 of the book talks about data sampling, missing values handling, and outlier processing, i.e., data engineering and feature engineering, in a detailed manner which intrigued my interest in developing and deploying ML models. This part has explained in-depth concepts and how understanding neural networks and deep learning helped train models more efficiently. As we move forwards, Dr. Song deep dives into machine learning and talks about mastering ML in GCP and Google cloud vertex AI. Some of the vertex AI products and services are mentioned in this part, such as Vertex AI data labeling and datasets, Vertex AI Feature Store, Vertex AI Workbench and notebooks, Vertex AI training, Vertex AI Metadata, etc. This concept helps me understand how Google Vertex AI provided users a complete platform to build, train, and deploy ML applications in Google Cloud from end to end. Part 4 of the book made you test your learned concepts in previous parts through practice questions for people who want to get a certificate in Google Cloud Certified Machine Learning. Last but not least, part 5 of the book includes appendices, including practice exercises that give you hands-on experience on the topics covered within the book.Some of the Pros that really distinguish this book from any other available book:• This book starts from basic to advanced concepts, which will help novice readers to help make great foundational concepts.• All the concepts mentioned are also complemented by the labs that help the reader to get hands-on experience.• This book helps me prepare for certifications such as Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer and GCP ML Certification.• I started getting my interview calls for beginner roles as soon as I mentioned a few of the projects I worked on while reading this book in my resume.Some of the improvements I think need to be implemented in future publications are:• I would recommend introducing some MCQs at the end of every part or chapter to test the reader's knowledge; if required reader can revisit the topic to get a strong foothold in those concepts.• More applications, visualizations (plots), and explanations of python data libraries and packages (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) would give the reader a better idea of those packages/libraries and what they do.• A few grammatical mistakes need to be rectified, such as ""problem framing"" should be problem-framing on page 26, and ""offer"" should be offered on page 109.• This book should introduce comparisons among other clouds, GCP, AWS, and Azure. Which cloud provider is more suitable in the case of machine learning?• The book does not provide much detail on specific machine-learning algorithms or models. So, readers looking for a more comprehensive guide to machine learning may want to look elsewhere.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Journey to Become a Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineer: Build the mind and hand of a Google Certified ML professional

Clear examples and simple instructions have been given to demonstrate the technical aspects of programming, The next phase was a step-by-step introduction to machine learning, which began with defining ML challenges and progressed through data collection, testing, and deployment of the model and various Neural network types. I learned about numerous new tools from the book, including TensorFlow, BQML, Google Cloud Big Query, and Kera’s. Instead of going straight to developing and deploying, the approach to machine learning started with preparing for ML development. This made me realize how crucial it is to prepare, define, comprehend, and discover a solution. I was given ML problem categories, which made it easier for me to comprehend any issues. A component of understanding, classifying, and handling data was also included. You can build a model without writing any code by using Vertex AI's AutoML with the training data that is given. The book provides guidance on creating various models and gives examples of the kinds of data that can be used for each model. One of the solutions Vertex AI offers for a range of data formats and modeling goals is autoML. Furthermore, I should mention how the book gives excellent practices for using Google Cloud ML. Important ML components, such as data preparation and where to obtain it, are systematically discussed by the author. editing your model. Having your data get through the ML training: constructing the modelAnd evaluating the performance of the models. the process of utilizing your completed model.Employing an Online Forecasting Tool to Submit Prediction Requests to Your Model.

"I’ve started to take a liking to the cloud computing subject for a long time. However, I’ve researched many books online, but almost all of them were either too difficult to understand or too generic, but I can say with complete confidence that this book is unlike any other book I have come across so far. This book entails all the concepts starting from the minute details to the most complex subjects, in a clear and concise manner.I’ve struggled so hard to find a book like this previously. To put it in more clear terms, the value of the book can be simply understood by just looking at the index. The structure and the flow of the book, the way it has been designed, is clearly unbeatable. The book walks you through the fundamentals of the google cloud environment, Python, and ML models to Explore and discover the Google Cloud Vertex AI and ML API.  The book also allows you to practice the concepts explained with real-life business use cases provided in the appendix region. This part has helped me a lot in understanding and grasping the concepts quickly. Along with a brief description, I’d also like to share a few pros and cons of the book to give a better understanding of book.Pros:• The book has nicely categorized the concepts in fundamentals of the google cloud and python for beginners to easily understand without doing any background research or losing the understanding to other websites to understand the details of it• Provided best practicing GCP services that enable one to explore the problems and trigger their solution-finding methods• clearly explains the concepts with clean diagrams depicting the functions and operations, and networks with a clean visual representationCons:Although there really aren’t many cons to this book, there are a few things that could’ve made this book more valuable.• Even though the book has the best practicing examples provided in the appendix region of the book, it has no immediate examples, or use-cases provided right down to the concept to grasp the knowledge quickly. I personally found going to the back of the book every time I wanted to practice a little tedious• I had to google a few terms in the book which went unexplained. Explaining them would’ve been a little helpful. Although the book explains the concepts to the minute detail, there are still a few terms that were missed as they might’ve been too fundamental",5.0 out of 5 stars,Journey to Become a Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineer: Build the mind and hand of a Google Certified ML professional
"“Journey to Become a Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineer” by Dr. Logan Song is a book highly recommended for anyone who would want to not just learn but truly understand the concept of Machine Language in cloud while preparing themselves to become a Google certified cloud ML engineer. I started reading the book with basic knowledge of Google Cloud which I thought would not be adequate, but the book helps you ease into the concepts and topics it provides which helped me get through the book instead of backing away. The flow of concepts in the book helps you understand the information while building a base for the succeeding concept. The author emphasizes that the best practice to learn ML is to study while simultaneously learning by performing the labs which helps understand how it works and how it reacts to the inputs submitted.The book starts off with an overview of the major sections of the GCP infrastructure which includes some topics like GCP structure, IAM, Storage, AI and many more which helps strengthen your base knowledge of GCP. The author includes some basics of Python which I felt was the best approach for a new reader like me to polish my python skills to work on GCP. Next was a step-by-step introduction to Machine Learning where it started off with defining ML problems while collecting data, testing, and deploying the model and the different types of Neural networks. The book introduced me to tools like Google Cloud BigQuery, BQML, TensorFlow, Keras and many more. I felt that the addition of the “Best Practices” information really helped me implement ML in GCP the right way. The detailed information provided in Part 5: Appendices helps ease through each practice session provided. This helped me not only run through the practice instructions but truly understand each command while also understanding how the tool reacts to the instruction. The few drawbacks I felt were present were that it is essential to have a good basic knowledge of GCP, it would take a while to ease into the lab practices and maybe more exam practice questions for more topics while also more questions for lab sessions where you can try different instructions to see how the system would react or what output would be provided.I would highly recommend this book for readers who plan to excel in Google Cloud Machine Learning while preparing themselves for the Google certification exam to become a Google certified Cloud Machine Language Engineer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Journey to Become a Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineer: Build the mind and hand of a Google Certified ML professional

I highly recommend adding quick questions/lab exercises between chapters or between topics within a chapter, which may add as a precursor to the questions in Part 4: Accomplishing GCP ML Certification, to help practice different topics immediately after reading them.2. Though all the chapters are concise to the point and well rounded, I believe Part3: Mastering ML in GCP Chapters 8 and 9 could've used more graphical examples or pictures to give a clearer experience to the reader.3. A few interview questions or self-assessment questions on certain functional hands-on concepts could help aspiring students more.4. Personally, I would love to learn a little more than what the author teaches about Kubernetes and important analytics services such as Google Cloud Dataproc and  BigQuery, I wish there were more chapters surrounding these topics.Reader will draw best results from this book if they follow the appendix exercises and the links provided at the end of every chapter thoroughly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Journey to Become a Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineer: Build the mind and hand of a Google Certified ML professional

"I've enjoyed reading Dr.Logan Song's book titled - ""Journey to become a Google CloudMachine Learning Engineer"". The book emphasis thoroughly on all aspects and helps gain a foundational understanding specifically on google cloud services and python(Part 1), fundamentals of machine learning and neural network(Part 2) and finally incorporating Machine Learning on google cloud(Part 3).I would like to thank Dr.Logan Song for this detailed guide about how to accomplish GCP ML certification(P.S : Provides exam practice questions as well)Personally, I did previously have a foundational understanding of machine learning but post reading helped refresh a lot of concepts right from the basics such as understanding business need, basic numpy and pandas function, principles of data engineering, feature engineering, various machine learning algorithms and furthermore a deep dive into core neural network principles.I was personally excited to implement and setup google cloud on my local machine due to the detailed figurative guide in the appendix. Kudos to that!A wonderful inclusion is the API section(Chapter 8), which really helps in today's day and age to automate the data extraction process from databases. The pretrained API services would help provide interfaces for ML application development. The inclusion of business use-cases further helped me understand the concept wellCons:1. As a non-IT background individual, I often felt the gap in understanding of general IT applications and services, so maybe a comprehensive background on this pre-requisite(i.e., network sharing, peering, etc.) could serve as a good knowledge point for individuals new in the IT domain.2. I felt there could be improvement on bridging the gap between google cloud services and machine learning as to why we really need this powerful joint platform.For example, it could contain background on how data systems have evolved over the years and why we need such intricate platforms of machine learning to provide real-time insights, benefits of using a google cloud platform.It could also include a brief guidance documentation as to why companies should choose to consider incorporating these services(cost, budgeting, infrastructure, training, etc. )The book is totally recommended and I'm excited to leverage these learnings in the dynamic business world to solve the most challenging and pressing problems in the world using Google Cloud.

"I bought this book at the beginning of my master's where I studied primarily econometrics & ML. I couldn't understand a word of it then. Since working through the two year program, I find this book to be at the perfect level where it's highly challenging, but not incomprehensible. If you've got some background in statistics, time series analysis, machine learning, portfolio management and Python, this book is for you. If not, I would recommend developing a strong feel for the basics of those topics before you try to tackle this one. There's still sections that are totally out of reach for me (e.g., the quantum computing stuff). Ironically, he basically calls econometrics a total waste of time, but econometrics is what gave me the ability to understand this book at all, so I guess not that much of a waste of time! Haha. Regardless, it's a great challenge with a lot of interesting stuff. The author is contactable too. I've had questions that he's responded too. Also, it was a good feeling to see I had really learned quite a bit after two years in a master's program. So, if you're headed to grad school, grab a copy of this, see what you can make out before you start, and then pick it up after and see how far you've come!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Advances in Financial Machine Learning
"Well-written, well-researched book that provides new insight in many areas; much better than your run-of-the-mill book that gives a cursory overview of topics like ML and finance. It's obvious from reading this book that the author knows what he's talking about. The book is for people who already know something about both ML and machine trading systems; it's not an introduction. A major theme of the book is the danger of backtest overfitting.Highly recommended!An overview of topics follows, focusing on things I found the most useful.Part 1: Data Analysis (chapters 1-5)Chapter 1 includes a list of reasons that financial ML projects usually fail. It's nice to have the warning at the outset of what traps to avoid.Chapter 2 discusses ways to represent market information; there are surprises here you wouldn't think of on your own, such as ""Tick Imbalance Bars"", which show up here only because the author has significant experience in HFT (cf. one of his earlier books on market microstructure.)Chapter 3 on Labelling addresses some issues I ran into myself working on dataset preparation. How to do appropriate labelling in computational finance isn't as obvious as in some other ML domains. Chapter 4 continues with appropriate weights for data samples, which help deal with data that violates the IID assumption.I knew the basics of ARIMA processes and the idea of time series stationarity before reading this book, but Chapter 5 introduced me to fractionally differentiated time series, which appears in earlier literature in the 1980s, but which somehow I had missed. This is important in dealing with time series with long memory.Part 2, Modeling (chapters 6-9)Part 2 has a different focus than some readers might expect, talking about modeling in general, but without mentioning specific ML models, such as linear regressions, neural nets, random forests, etc. The book states in its introduction that it is intended to be model-agnostic, and covers issues affecting modeling in general.Chapter 6, for instance, is on ensembles. Chapter 7 deals with cross-validation in financial time series, which is a crucial topic for any model evaluation, and chapter 8 talks about feature importance. Chapter 9 is on hyper-parameter tuning.Part 3: Backtesting (chapters 10-16).Chapter 10 covers bet sizing.Chapter 11-16 discuss backtesting in great detail, including the dangers involved, good statistics to compute, synthetic data use, more on cross-validation, and strategy risk and asset allocation/optimization.Part 4 (chapters 17-19) is called ""Useful Financial Features"" -- it's about feature engineering, and has a bunch of features that will be new to many readers (there are ""entropy features"" and ""microstructure features"", for instance; this isn't just the basic stuff related to returns and volatility.Part 5 (chapters 20-22) seemed the least useful to me, on high-performance computing, since I personally was already aware of this stuff and there is a lot more to say on the topic than these few chapters could cover.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Advances in Financial Machine Learning
"A fantastic addition to finance literature with must read chapters on backtesting pitfalls, hierarchical risk parity, deflated Sharpe ratios, explosiveness tests, entropy(complexity) estimators, and microstructural features.  You can and should read this book even with no knowledge of machine learning.  You will find it more useful if you have worked through the first four chapters of Aurelian Geron’s Hands-On Machine Learning.  No knowledge of fully connected neural networks, convolutional networks or recurrent networks is required.Dr de Prado works in the realm of systematic quantitative investing.  I think of this as trading rather than investing, where you expect to make a large number of decisions, each with a probability of success somewhat over 50%.  The comprehensive book Expected Returns by Antti Ilmanen explains how difficult it is to find systematic opportunities that last.  I suspect this applies to all quantitative strategies, including ones informed by machine learning, although we all would love to understand exactly how the folks at Renaissance Technologies construct and update their models.I think of investing as making a small number of decisions based on extensive due diligence, where you expect a high probability of success, much greater than 50%.  A private equity professional or an old fashioned stock picker like Warren Buffett makes at most a handful of investment decisions a year.  If they see a business with legs, one that will sustain growth of 20%+ per year trading a P/E of under 20, that business is unlikely to see much multiple compression and so is likely to yield 15% annual returns over the next 5 years.  Or they might anticipate similar returns from a mature business growing at 5% per year-  with no margin erosion - and 10% free cash flow yields.  These investors usually work best in teams due to the broad scope of their due diligence and also to achieve some diversification.  I do believe Dr de Prado’s ideas can be used to help inform some of these decisions but clearly we are dealing in the world of small numbers, even at the largest private equity groups and hedge funds.  Nevertheless, any young professional entering these fields would benefit by at least understanding how to work with data scientists who can help improve their decision making.I am inclined to agree with Dr de Prado that there are a lot of charlatans in the investing/trading world and it is not easy to figure out who they are.  This, taxes and the wonders of compounding in a low signal to noise world are what makes low cost passive investing the right choice for most people trying to build a nest egg for retirement.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Advances in Financial Machine Learning
"If you're coming from a computer science and/or machine learning background, you will learn a lot about how to frame your algorithmic thinking in the domain of finance and will leave you hungry for more hardcore graph theory, parallelization, machine learning (beyond simple random forest ensembles and clustering), advanced algorithms, and gutty details of implementation, which are left for you to explore and enjoy.The purpose of this book is not to explain how to apply Deep Learning to make money, but rather to lay a solid foundation of how to invest in a scientifically rigorous fashion given the modern machine learning toolset and access to PBs of data. In many cases, rather than focussing on the specifics of any given model, Dr. Lopez de Prado focuses on generating and selecting useful features.The book, which is a hybrid of a textbook and a manual, explains using both formal mathematics and empirical evidence why many of the assumptions about Machine Learning applied to the financial world are wrong and follows through with rigorous and practical solutions. For example, one of the most common false assumptions addressed in the book is that of IID samples in financial time series data.Dr. Lopez de Prado manages to pull together ideas from a wide spectrum of academic disciplines including mathematics, econometrics, machine learning, computer science, information theory, and physics to build a strong scientific basis upon which to algorithmically invest. Despite the diversity of subject matter, the book progresses well, building on and reusing early themes and then exploring domain specific topics like market microstructure and quantum computing. Source code to implement many of the methods is provided as a practical toolkit to test out the claims presented. The thorough use of references is particularly helpful as it keeps the content fairly short and to the point.Speed reading not recommended. Using a programming analogy, the mathematical notation is more reminiscent of the explicit verbosity of C++ than that of python (which is used in the book and is meant to be concise). It's not much of a problem but be aware the information content is dense.Something that's mentioned but not explored is how to make use of “alternative datasets”. Given many of the advances in the wider realm of ML have been around data you don’t get from exchanges, it would be nice if some helpful pointers or references for dealing with alternative data were included. That said, it's not the end of the world given the wealth of resources online for analyzing text, image, and video data.Buy this book if you're an experienced programmer getting into Finance or a Financial Professional looking to strengthen your algorithmic understanding. It is densely packed with a wealth of practical methods and breaks down and offers alternatives to faulty investing science.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Advances in Financial Machine Learning
"TLDR: the book is awesome, it really is on another level, and you will be stuck in the past if you don't ingest this book.If you are not in the target audience I think you will find this book hard to digest.  Also I have read some chapters twice and worked through the code samples, so I believe I offer a perspective that other readers may be lacking.  Marcos has given a number of lectures titled  “The 7 Reasons Most Machine Learning Funds Fail”, you can find the lecture slides online.  The seven core ideas in that lecture are covered in chapters 2-8, with other chapters offering supporting details, or going further in depth.  If you have limited time to process the book, I think you would be better served by taking a deep dive on chapters 2-8, rather than skimming the whole thing.The ideas in this book work, and you would be doing yourself a disservice by not reading this book.  Some of the ideas range from the common sense (backtesting is not a research tool, feature importance is) to the heretical (""fordecades most financial research has been based on over-differentiated (memory-less) series, leading to spurious forecasts and overfitting."")  [That quote was in his 7 Reasons presentation from Quantcon 2018, not the book.]  He offers compelling arguments and solutions backed by peer reviewed publications for all his points.The book would be a highly valuable reference even without the code snippets, but he provides functional code and even tools to make it work on large datasets.  Once again this code is not for the faint of heart, his use of Pandas will leave even a seasoned financial developer to RTFM.There are some flaws which I can overlook.  Strict software engineers will be irked at the code violating PEP8.  It is hard to put code samples into a book so things like multiple statements per line can greatly compact the code and make it readable.  In chapter 20 he uses threads and processes interchangeably although they are two distinct tools.  Chapter 22 felt a little out of place but it seems compulsory for financial authors to include a ""just for fun"" final chapter.  There was a quick discussion at the end of Chapter 14 on performance attribution, which felt rushed and I feel it would be hard for the non-financial portion of the target audience to follow.  These are minor items.  I found at least three errors in the code which I hear have been corrected in the second printing.It is arguable that the ideas in this book could be extended to any asset class.  If I had to guess, I would say this was often applied to trading futures, although bonds, equities, and equity options are briefly mentioned.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Advances in Financial Machine Learning
"I have run through a quick pass of the entire text in one sitting, so I may possibly re-read more in depth and alter my review at some point in the future.My impression is that the text reads a bit like an academic survey of some existing ML methods applied to quantitative finance, a bit heavy on theoretical models and sourcing many fairly recent papers culled from various financial and machine learning literature, many referenced from the author himself. However, the author also points out that he has a lot of experience in the quantitative field and elaborates a bit on the overall systematic step by step process of development that a real team of quants might use. Don't expect an in depth description of specific implementations (like SVMs, Gradient Boosting, NNs,etc), but a more general approach to the various learner methods.The Good:I enjoyed getting his perspective on the overall flow and piece by piece breakdown on each of the steps involved in the process of developing a ML based algorithm, from data collection, partitioning, and scrubbing, all the way to the design and execution phase, including a lengthy description of some of the pitfalls and possible solutions to using various cross-validation methods, in order to gain better confidence in financial data and algorithms, that many already know suffer from characteristics like non-IID properties, data overlap, and time dependencies. On the more concrete side, he also presents many standalone python based functions to concretely implement many of the concepts that he describes.The bad:While it definitely reads like it is written from someone with a strong theoretical background, and much experience in the financial field. I also, felt that it fails in that it never really integrates all of the build up to a practical example of a systematic design implementation, that uses many of his ideas and demonstrates their validity. In other words, do not expect any top level concrete design or systematic design and back-test examples with real financial data and results at all.  It is mainly bits and pieces of the pipeline that ultimately may go into a complete systematic development of a system, but no real evidence that any of it is of use, other than to take the author's word, or just accept the theoretical modelling. To clarify further, it's ok to point out the shortcomings of classical portfolio optimization, but show a clear example of an ML based portfolio optimization; how does it perform using various validation methods compared to classical? Using real, cleaned financial data.It would definitely be useful to see at least one complete implementation of a system that utilizes the methods described within. In addition, concepts like quantum computing are great and all, but when you've been at this development long enough, the more fancy and advanced the tools sound, they don't really bring all that much to the table, if you can't even develop a successful system or algorithm at a much simpler level (which is not easy).update(s): I'll just add that, after a closer reading, hasn't really changed my opinion much. However, if it helps anyone I found an excellent simulation of HRP, using real financial data on ilya kipnis great R based blog, QuantStratTradeR. This is the kind of empirical data, that would really add value to the text.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Advances in Financial Machine Learning
"As a student pursuing both academic and professional knowledge for sound mathematical and empirical based experience in higher finance, Marcos Lopez de Prado’s career serves as an inspiration for my pursuit of truth. To gain data integrity in understanding the ever-changing differences in higher finance,  FinTech, big data, machine learning, and quantum computing  are making distinct changes in looking at a financial trading model. After all, looking at a financial trading model, one must adopt a skeptical data mindset in order to formulate investor credibility from Bloomberg pulled data. Drilling down to data credibility, Prado examines various factors that obscure a supply data model and therefore reduce the information that may be derived. Given a large and diverse supply population, backtesting becomes a crucial retrospective that may give pointers to trading forecasts, but they are only pointers; looking backwards is at best simple guide forecasting. Complex, and often hard to understand topic are covered, which are essential reads for anyone interested in financial risk analysis, financial data, software, hardware, math.  meta-strat, and overfitting are covered and defining the sharpe ratio and its common derivatives, such as common derivatives such as Deflated Sharpe Ratio after its extensive earlier use are covered. Several strategic risk and then portfolio risk are well covered in focusing on Asset Allocation, reviewing Markowitz’s Curse, Tree Clustering, Out-of-Sample Monte Carlo Simulations, Inverse Variance Allocation and others. Shannon’s Entropy and other financial applications of entropy then follow as does a review of Microstructural Feature publications including various Lamda’s such as Kyle’s and Hasbrouck’s. Simple illustrations conclude with brute force in Quantum Computing to find optimum solutions by examining all feasible solutions at the same time. Considering the maturity of Quantum Computing, the amount of advances especially to standard models somewhat lacking.  In terms of discerning the academic science from the empirical based evidence, Lopez de Prado’s work is an incredible usage of both academic and practitioner truth, in terms of accurately using mathematical tools to describe actual observations. In a constant skeptical approach from pseudo science to mathematical precision, Lope de Prado adopts a framework of explanations to describe actual relevant changes in quantitative finance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Advances in Financial Machine Learning

"There are many famous books that teach you Machine Learning,  Econometrics, Quant Finance. While all these books are good, they often concentrate on the single subject instead of a combination of those. Many of us might be good at Quant Finance or only Machine Learning, but we often find it troubling to connect the bridge between the two worlds. Lopez de Prado's book is a synergy of both Quant Finance and ML in this way.  The book teaches the right way to apply machine learning in finance and covers a lot of applications related to asset allocation, high-frequency finance, Quant Trading etc.The book is divided into 5 parts with each part building up to a more advanced material.  Part one discusses different kinds of financial data and how to use them for analysis and training purposes. Part two discusses modeling covering important algorithms, their merits, and demerits when applied to financial data. Part three concentrates on the dangers of Backtesting in today's practice, and the right way to conduct backtesting, and interpret the backtest statistics as its really important that ML models don't suffer from data mining.  My favorite one in this part was the Machine Learning Asset Allocation chapter which solves the minimum variance problem compared to Markowitz's or Risk Parity methods. Part four discusses various advanced applications related to Quant Trading, Portfolio construction, Market Microstructure. Part five is not for the faint-hearted as it teaches various advanced computer science techniques to speed up the performance ML algorithms in practice.Overall, the book lets you change the way that one traditionally thinks about financial data and ML applications on it.  I'd recommend this book to any aspiring quant working/wants to work in ML quant research. To the people who already purchased, The best way to use the book is to try out the algorithms yourself (All the Python code is on Lopez de Prado's website) and study its applications and results.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Advances in Financial Machine Learning
"Frankly, I'm amazed that this book even has 1-start reviews. Yes, it's very complicated. I'm a specialist in Machine Learning, Finance and Python and a professional programmer by trade before, though not a good mathematician. By now I read through it 16 times, no exaggeration, and I still keep finding new important nuances that I missed before.But come on, I've read through almost everything I can find on the topic. This book is by far the best and one of the only that actually discloses useful things regarding how to adapt our ML models to finance and how to avoid ruining mistakes.I and my team spend years building our own ML models and pipelines to predict financial markets. By now I like to believe that we understand at least something about how markets work. We've challenged every idea Marcos wrote in his book, and there is plenty. So far, we've managed to improve on 2 or 3 of them. Every other time it turned out that Marcos was looking far ahead into the future and considered things we didn't even know would be a problem.So, whatever the complexity of the book and the style it's written in. I'm giving it 5 stars and a huge thanks to Marcos for writing it. I already preordered the next one and eagerly waiting to give it a read, hoping that he managed to come up with more of the same amazing stuff he disclosed in Advances. That would be outstanding.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Advances in Financial Machine Learning
"I love this book. It's cutting-edge and comprehensive as nothing else on the market and has the right mathematical level (for me, at any rate; I find this to be about right, and Hastie et al to be a bit hard). It makes a great desk reference for day-to-day work.Speaking of comprehensiveness, did you want to know about a symmetric version of KL divergence? It's there in 2.8.2. How about dynamic latent dirichlet allocation? See 27.4.2. Examples from cognitive science? See his refs to Tenenbaum and Xu's work. How about a reference to the fact that consistent preferences allow one to represent them as utilities? See 5.7.3.2. The discussion on utilities is brief, but I appreciate this sort of connection-making between disciplines (ML and micro-economics, in this case), even if cursory. Please note: I don't mean to suggest that his comprehensiveness is merely a question of making short references, rather that over and above all the deep & detailed material he presents he still finds the time/space to add these little cross-connections that, to me, make the book a lot more valuable.Minor complaints: I wonder why he didn't give much attention to newer neural network architectures (e.g. lstm). It also seems a bit weird that he seems to think of Bayesianism as the ""one true way"", and I say this as someone who loves the Bayesian philosophy. These are minor quibbles.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)
"I've found this to be a unified presentation that is somewhat easier to follow than any of the other big ML books, the author is a wonderful teacher. The software that accompany's the book is excellent, lends clarity to the text, and is useful to the practitioner.Disappointingly however - the software has been archived at google and moved to git hub - so the code library no longer works with respect to automatically downloading data, which is a big part of what makes it so nice, as you can then run the examples which use that data. It is not clear if the data files can be downloaded from git hub or not. There does not seem to be any information regarding this to be found which seems to indicate their is not a lot of active development going on with the software. If it were not for this problem I would give it 5 stars in a second.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)
"I'd think of this book as a reference book for the field of Machine Learning. It has a bit of everything in it but it doesn't have enough room to cover everything in depth, although it does do so for a few topics (Especially Gaussian Models in Chapter 4).  You'll need supplementary texts such as BRML (Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning; Barber) and Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms; MacKay), for example. Both of these books are freely distributed in electronic format by their authors.  Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop) is also a great book.  I also found some videos made by Varun Chandola for a ML course at the University of Buffalo on YouTube.  Since I'm new to the field, the videos really helped me through the first several chapters, which is all you need.  Once you understand the fundamentals, you can read the rest of the chapters without much of a problem.  It's still a big effort, though.All in all, it's a great book but you have to realize that if the author tried to cover every topic in depth it would be 5 times as big as it already is. So, naturally, some steps in the math are going to be cut out, left as an exercise to the reader, yadda-yadda. I think it's still a 5-star reference book, though.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)
"After I read this thread [...], I decide to buy this MLAPP.  I am not working closely on machine learning, but I use machine learning techniques frequently in my research. The review is partial, because I only carefully read some independent parts.When decide to buy this book. I care about and expect to obtain information on 1) the appropriateness of when I choose a machine learning method for a task; 2)  the big picture of whole machine learning techniques; 3) the intuition of important techniques explained without jargons, and 4) how are these techniques connected;Additionally, as an English as a second language (ESL) user, I expect the text is well organised and is written without ambiguity.From my partial reading (mainly section 16.6 and some random stuff), I would say the book indeed covers many popular techniques (topic models, deep learnings). The author also did a very good job in describing terminologies and giving succinct descriptions about the key part and the application of each method. These are the two features I like most.However, the downsides are 1) it is too abstract for some method descriptions that I need to leverage external materials (e.g. the original paper) to understand the method. Even though the description in the book covers the most important part, it is not sufficient and I would like to see more details. One example is in equation 16.105, why P_b(X) is not explained?2) The text is like an oral presentation in a very long tutorial intended to cover an index of techniques. Overall, its readability (text in Section 16.6) dispoints me. I know English is not my native language. But I would still argue for this issue.

Understanding these communalities makes it a lot easier to communicate with non-economist data scientists.At a practical level, the book provides technical explains & provides solid technical rationale for a lot of modelling tricks I've used in the past, & suggested some very clever new ones.This book is accessible for anyone with a background in reasonably advanced econometrics, say at level of W.

Learning books, I find that this book provides me with the most cohesive andcomprehensive framework for understanding and using ML  algorithms/models. It has definitely become my'gold standard' for reviewing ML related concepts. I find this author's notation and terminology the most usefulcompared to other books. Also the author stresses the separation of the model from the algorithm. ""This kind ofmodularity, where we distinguish the model from the algorithms, is good pedagogy and good engineering"" - the author.

I have the fifth printing, and it is on page 118, section 4.3.3, equation number (4.91).

"""Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective"" is truly ambitious in its scope.  A major selling point of this work is that it covers material, such as deep learning, that other large surveys leave out.  There are also some genuine insights in the book.  A new perspective is always welcome in this growing technical field, and Dr. Murphy appears to have a lot to offer here.However, the book suffers in its current form (my copy is the second printing) from the author's and publisher's hurry to get it in print.  (The author admits, on the site devoted to the book, that such a rush existed.)  The result is a book that, as other reviewers have noted, is less than perfectly organized and riddled with typographical and technical errors.The errata notes on the author's site suggest that the third printing will be much improved over the first and second (including, among other things, an essentially rewritten chapter).  My guess, though, is that it will take a good few years before the book's errors are altogether extirpated.  (Aside: Why is it nearly impossible to determine the current printing of a book before you're actually holding it in your hands?  This is pretty important if you're trying to get the cleanest copy possible.)This book has all the ingredients of a five-star ML text.  At the moment, though, it is hard to justify more than a three-star rating (especially given its hefty price).  I suspect that my ultimate rating will be a function of the book's printing number, its exact shape depending largely on the diligence of the publisher, the author, and his readership.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)

"I admit that there are only very few machine learning books that have enough mathematics. And to make it worse, I found that even these very rare books occasionally cannot do the mathematics right. So I did not expect that this book would be perfect when I started reading this book. I also knew there would be many typos and all that, but I honestly do not mind that too much.Unfortunately this book still makes me feel really disappointed. I do not want to waste my time to tell people how bad this book is, but I want to be constructive in that I want to make this review helpful.Good: the subjects of this book are very broad in machine learning field. This is the reason that I bought this book.Bad: presentations of the contents. I really doubt that the author himself actually understands what he wrote in the book for some sections. The mathematics are way off in some parts. For example, the interpolating noise free data (page 114) and interpolating noisy data (page 125). And some basic simple mathematical facts are messed up over and over again. For example, quote ""One problem with the Gaussian distribution is that it is sensitive to outliers, since the log probability ONLY decays quadratically with distance from the center."" You know what the problem is here if you have some basic understanding of the mathematics and probabilities.Overall I give it three star mostly because the author did a decent job when he does understand what he is talking about.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)

"AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty: MLS-C01 Certification Guide: The definitive guide to passing the MLS-C01 exam on the very first attemptBy Somanath NandaDisclaimer:  This review has been requested by the publisher, and I am giving my honest review of this book.  This review is based on reading the book.  As with any Packt publication, it's also necessary to try out the code, which I will at a later point in time.OverviewThis book covers the areas tested in the AWS Machine Learning Specialty exam.  In addition to providing the info, it also has practice questions that are like the questions asked in the MLS-C01 exam.  Although I plan to take this exam in a couple of months, I am already using this book as a reference for ways to approach an NLP project I’m working on.  This book will make me a better practitioner of machine learning because it provides context for which algorithms work better in which situations.  It will probably become one of the short-list references to use when embarking on a new ML project.What I like about this bookThis book takes you from the ‘big picture’ basics of machine learning in the first chapter, to recent powerful algorithms such as LDA to find topic models within natural language processing.The book is organized into these sections:• Fundamentals• Data Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)• Data Modeling and Evaluating ModelsWithin each section there are chapters that tie in the specific AWS services that help you accomplish the step in the data pipeline.  For example, within the EDA section, there’s a chapter on Data Visualization.  Most of the chapter is about the different types of visualizations, which are important and why- with examples.  At the end, AWS QuickSight is mentioned as the way to visualize data.The Data Storing and Data Processing chapters bring together the many AWS services that support the data access and data wrangling that takes between 80 to 95% of a Data Scientist’s time.  It is helpful to see how each of the services fit together in the ML work flow.In most chapters, there is a hands-on portion to try out the AWS capabilities discussed in that chapter.  ‘Doing’ cements my learning best- so this is much appreciated.Another reviewer pointed out that this book would have been very helpful when studying for the MLS-CO1 exam. He also mentioned there is no other book like this on the market.  I will definitely use this book, as well as a Udemy course to help me prepare for the exam. If the course assumes too much knowledge, this book will be perfect for supplementing anything I may have forgotten or didn’t completely understand.What I don’t like about this bookIn some chapters the AWS service is mentioned but there is no hands-on example.  This is true, for example, in the Data Visualization chapter.  QuickSight is mentioned and discussed, but there is no hands-on example.  Since I haven’t taken the exam yet, this may be a very appropriate choice given how the exam is laid out.  However, when using this book as a reference, it might be helpful to have the hands-on example.  I understand there is a tradeoff between completeness and covering the material that matters to pass the exam.OverallAWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty: MLS-C01 Certification Guide is a much-needed addition to the resources that help people who want to solidify their ML skills and those who want to study for the MLS-C01 exam.",5.0 out of 5 stars,AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty: MLS-C01 Certification Guide: The definitive guide to passing the MLS-C01 exam on the very first attempt

The book would have been great if a little bit more effort was spent for extra proof-reading and editing by a technical writer / professional editor.

"I have IT background as a Python Software Developer (1 year of experience) and nothing to do with mathematics(statistics, linear algebra, calculus,...) or machine learning related stuffs.I've only read through the first 3 chapter and i can say: This book is very easy to read and follow by each chapter. No mathematical background required. Extremely well organized and i think this book will provide a solid basic foundation for you to dig deeper into more complex problems using machine learning.The second edition also include a small section of ""Unsupervised learning"" which is very well writtenThere's a whole section of Appendixes for who are not familiar with some maths stuff. Also very well written.There's no code provided. Only theory and some formulas but it's easy to grasp if you read carefully and slowly. The theory is very well explained before dive deeper into complex parts. The pros and cons, variations of each algorithms are also discussed thorougly.Highly recommend for people who are:-Completely newbie: no background of anything required.-Want to learn its applications through case studies.-Want to know how a machine learning lifecycle looks like and other business requirements before applying machine learning to solve business's problem.-Grasp a solid foundation of machine learning models: how does this model work,when to use, how to use, other considerations ...-Or to expand further knowledge of WHAT,WHEN and HOW to use machine learning.This book will serve you well on your machine learning journey.Note: Most parts of this book is focusing on Predictive Analytics.

"If you have seen one of Lopez de Prado's lectures, you will understand immediately that his work offers advances to standard problems in portfolio management. This small book summarizes the main contributions and cannot be recommended strongly enough.The book is comprised of several very dense chapters of all new material in the field. These include advances in covariance estimation based on random matrix theory, optimal clustering, labelling methods for trend tracking, using ML for variable selection for prediction, hierarchical risk parity (instead of Markowitz portfolio optimization) for portfolio selection, and two alternatives to standard sharpe-ratio back testing of strategies. All of these new methodologies address fundamental problems with the standard techniques that have been used for decades in portfolio theory and in sum represent a big step forward in the theory.This book is worth purchasing just to read the introduction. It gives great insight into how to use machine learning for finance that you won't find in any other book.The author devised a machine learning algorithm based on 'theories' of finance 'discovered' from machine learning, not based on back testing. This made all the difference during the flash crash. Unlike many others, his algorithm made lots of money during this period because of the way he designed it.This book will NOT teach you general machine learning techniques. As the author admits in the introduction, you must learn these things from other books. But the techniques here should be acquired by everyone in finance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning for Asset Managers (Elements in Quantitative Finance)

"The topics in this book are interesting, but it is so full of errors, some very material, that it leads one to doubt the conclusions it makes. Results stated in the text often do not correspond to the code snippets they refer to. The code snippets are full of bugs, some just blatantly careless as to suggest they were never tried, and it leads me to think there was minimal editing done.

"Marcos has brought attention to a number of interesting analysis techniques in the recent years.His previous book, Advances in Financial Machine Learning, was much more broad/technical in scope.  I enjoyed this text because it is much more concise and lays out a clear entry point into purely data-driven investing.The book begins by outlining a powerful and intuitive technique which can be used to de-noise correlation matrices.  Marcos provides strong validation for this methodology with stylized Monte Carlo.Using MC in this way is an innovative idea  -- one which the physics community has embraced for decades.  In particle physics we rely on Monte Carlo to remove reliance on empirically collected data and to validate our understanding.  Applying this approach to finance is sure to bear fruit by bringing more objectivity to finance in the coming years.The book continues on in a similar manner to outline more clear and simple techniques which can yield similarly objective results.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning for Asset Managers (Elements in Quantitative Finance)
"Interesting, not because it contains new mathematical developments or ideas (most of the clustering related content is between 10 to 20 years old; same for the random matrix theory (RMT) part, which is already applied in many hedge funds and other sophisticated asset managers), but because all these existing ideas and methods (prevalent in the industry or in (some part of, e.g. econophysics rather than finance) academia) are, maybe for the first time, exposed clearly and linearly throughout the book. You may find RMT experts, clustering experts, optimizers in chief, and various frameworks to deal with multiple testing biases, but rarely all this knowledge is brought together in one place with a consistent presentation and set of notations.

"This book provides a theoretical, and practical source of learning to Machine Learning for Streaming Data, which is a “relatively concept is less widespread, and it is a bit harder to find model implementations and documentation for online learning use cases” (author words).Nevertheless, it walks through the subject in a structured way, with the background, theoretical explanations and code samples. From past experience, code samples tends not to work. In this case, all the samples worked flawlessly.I loved the short history of data science and challenges of streaming data in chapter 1. Microservices fundamentals, and Big data tools for real time streaming in chapter 2.In Part 2: Exploring Use Cases for Data Streaming, I loved the part of explaining online machine learning with advantages vs. challenges. River for online learning was a new framework for me, and it was nice to learn about the capabilities.I loved the structure of the chapters describing Online Anomaly Detection, Online Classification, Online Regression, and Reinforcement Learning. Starting with definition, identifying the use cases, and diving into code sample using Rivery.The last part of the book: Part 3: Advanced Concepts and Best Practices around Streaming Data was a very welcomed addition. The Drift and Drift Detection chapter was much beneficial to me. Learned a whole new concept around Catastrophic Forgetting.All in all, it is a good book to start with. You can learn the theory and experience with code samples.

"Joos Korstanje's ""Machine Learning for Streaming Data with Python"" is a solid technical introduction that provides a boots-on-the-ground introduction to deploying machine learning models for continuous streams of data, pitched to data scientists and machine learning engineers with a good understanding of ML fundamentals but interested in the unique problems posed when model parameters need to be continually updated online.After a practical guide to setting up a streaming API server through AWS, Korstanje explains how to adapt standard descriptive statistics to the streaming context, and how to deploy real-time descriptive dashboards in a business intelligence setting. What's particularly useful is the chapter on online learning using River—a wrapper for scikit-learn models with support for iteratively re-fitting model parameters with a data stream. The examples provide starter code for deploying online learning with River, though it would have been useful to cover the back-end procedure River uses for model fitting with various algorithms (e.g. reinitialization, running to convergence with augmented data, warm start), and the relative merits of each approach.The chapters about data/model drift and catastrophic forgetting set an important conceptual baseline for understanding online learning methods, and the code blocks provided for measuring data drift and detecting and analyzing drift with interpretable models are very useful for troubleshooting online inference. A nice addition would be an exploration of automated procedures for updating model architecture in response to drift, such as increasing model complexity when drift is detected so as not to harm performance on earlier examples from the stream.Overall, this is a very good practical guide to an underused set of data science techniques. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quickstart introduction to online learning and inference.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning for Streaming Data with Python: Rapidly build practical online machine learning solutions using River and other top key frameworks

"Review of Machine Learning for Streaming Data with Python(authored by Joos Korstanje)""Streaming viewership surpassed cable TV for the first time, says Nielsen”-- Headline from TechCrunch Article, 18 August 2022Data science is a calling.As Jennifer Shin, Senior Principal Data Scientist at Nielsen is quoted as saying:“’Possessed’ is probably the right word.  I often tell people, ‘I don’t want to necessarily be a data scientist.  You just kind of are a data scientist.  You just can’t help but look at that data set and go, ‘I feel like I need to look deeper.  I feel like that’s not the right fit.’”I think it’s interesting that I am writing this review of this particular book at this particular time, when Nielsen is reporting the (inevitable) ascendency of streaming viewership, (inevitably) surpassing that of cable.  The trend in that direction has been clear for years now.  And we hit that particular milestone just as Joos’ text is being published.  Good timing, coincidence, dharma or part of the Great Universe’s Master Plan, the fact is, the knowledge from this text must be assimilated well and  quickly by practitioners of the Art and Science of Machine Learning in production environments today.Streaming is the future of data processing.  Especially with a doubling of IoT-connected devices over the next four years, each one generating real-time feeds, each device begging for immediate consumption of their data, Machine Learning for Streaming Data must be mastered by those of us, like Jennifer, who are possessed by this calling.If you haven’t used the River package in python, this book offers a very useful tutorial.  River is a library to build online machine learning models using python.  What’s an ‘online ML model?’ It’s a term meant to differentiate between more traditional approaches to ML, called offline learning.Offline learning is an approach that ingests all the data at one time to build a model whereas online learning is an approach that ingests data one observation at a time.Online ML models operate on data streams. But the concept of a  data stream is a bit vague.In general, a data stream is a sequence of individual elements. In the case of machine learning, each element is a bunch of features. We call these samples, or observations. Each sample might follow a fixed structure and always contain the same features. But features can also appear and disappear over time, depending on the use case.Regardless of data source or use case, the River package can be very useful when it comes to ML for streaming data.I enjoyed digesting this book.  If you write code and need to jump-start your understanding of ML for streaming data, this is the text for you.

"This book is a very well written. Doesn’t go so much into detail but it’s still very intuitive. Small chapters are very informative and keep you interested in the topics. I used this book for the undergraduate class in ML I taught  and my students loved it. However, the paperback printing is awful. Very cheap papers and graphs are not colored. If you’d like to buy it just go with the original US edition of this book!Overall, the book is very nice for an introductory class in machine learning for an advanced undergraduate level class.

"I never write a review but I felt obligated because this is a great book. I read literally half of the book and then realized that this is not a book for someone who wants to apply ML (applied science) in finance. I have a PhD in deep learning and Masters in Control theory and i don't get attracted to theory anymore. The book has a sound progression in theory with zero emphasis on case studies. I felt reading a great graduate school book where all topics are covered without knowing how such knowledge can be applied. As other reviews say, this is 5 star in reference books but 1 star in practice so average would be 3! Lol",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Finance: From Theory to Practice
"[N.B.: this review is based on reading sections here and there, and on a careful reading of chapters 2, 3 and 10.] This book covers a large number of topics, with little theoretical or thematic overlap among them: bayesian methods, traditional time series methods, deep learning, dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. To paraphrase the title of the songs by Simple Talk: “ML is what you make it”. The topic are presented clearly, concisely and accurately. Because of the topic breadth, I expect this to serve primarily as a reference book, even if several chapter groups could be used as course material.While I think this book is above the average of its peers (""quant"" books on Big Data/ML/AI in finance), I was still somewhat disappointed. As a far-fetched comparison, consider the classic ""Elements of Statistical Learning"" (ELS) by Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani. Even when discussing well-trodden topics like OLS or ridge regression, the presentation felt new, engaging and original. I think this could be attributed to two factors. First, the life-long acquaintance of the authors with the subject matter; second, the topics in the book (statistical learning) were central to the book's aim (teach how to learn from data). The book uses fairly advanced math (matrix decompositions, RKHS) but if the book had been about ""Advanced Quantitative Methods for Statistical Learning"", it would have been uninteresting and forgettable. Now, let’s go back to the book at hand. Here, the goal should be in the *application* of these methods to finance. But there is preciously little of that, and what is there (e.g., on multiperiod optimal execution, or on comparison of factor models to deep factor models) is so superficial as to be pointless. For example, Factor Model estimation (and deep estimation) is not quite explained, and the comparison metric is at best a secondary one in factor model evaluation; and LQR solutions are not discussed. The book feels very removed from the work of actual quantitative traders, who should be the target audience of this work.Ultimately, whether the book succeeds or not is up to the reader. Probably for someone completely new to the topics of this book and in need of a reference, this is more than ok. My preference would still be to go for monographies, some of which freely available: the aforementioned ELS; ""Deep Learning"" by Goodfellow et al., ""Reinforcement Learning"" by Sutton and Barto (2nd ed); and the still-classic ""Dynamic Programming"" by Bertsekas. I am waiting for a book that a) selects methods that *work in financial investment* (I think I know a few) and that is organized around first-hand applications in Finance. Would it contain RL?I don’t think so. Deep learning? Yes. Latest-generation graphical models. Yes, too. All of it with plenty of commentary relative to financial event details, flow and liquidity models, and test. The simple fact is that *theory is cheap and abundant*. There are hundreds of published papers on ML in finance.It's the the successful method selection and the effort and intelligence in applying the method to a specific problem that are informative and valuable.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Finance: From Theory to Practice
"This book represents a very comprehensive guide to Machine Learning techniques in Finance and serves remarkably well both the students of quantitative and computational finance, as well as a large cross-section of industry’s practitioners. As someone who worked in this field for several decades, and wrote a book on this topic, I understand very well what it takes to put together a comprehensive guide on such a subject. Very rare are the books on this topic that address properly at the same time both the theoretical aspects of the problem at hand, as well as exemplifying these concepts with meaningful practical examples.A book on application of ML to Finance is not necessary about providing tons of Py codes, and this one serves the reader very well. But it should be about setting up a strong foundation for the theories and concepts that underlie the ML machinery, as well as exemplifying these concepts with model reasoning that is applicable to real world problems. And the reader is served again extremely well from this perspective.In my opinion this book introduces several novelties in a very crowded and sometimes over published field:- A very elegant and well documented exposition on financial times series modelling, especially regarding the use of RNNs and Kalman filtering techniques;- A mathematically sound and well exemplified section on the use of Reinforcement Learning, specifically promoting the use of Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning as modern tools for Optimal Control;- Blending the ever-powerful set of Bayesian thinking into the world of financial ML, by developing an intuition for the role of functional regularization in the classical statistical setting.I read this book and followed its Py code examples with great pleasure, and I strongly recommend it to anyone that is interested in applying these modern concepts, while having a solid understanding of the Mathematics that supports it. Enjoy it!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Finance: From Theory to Practice
"There are plenty of books on either quantitative finance or machine learning (ML). But finding a book about both topics is rare, let alone from the econometrics viewpoint. For one of us, a former Chief Economist, this book truly covers a gaping void. For example, this book presents modern approaches to modeling time series, such as recurrent neural networks as well as cutting-edge architectures, such as alpha-RNN. Uniquely, neural networks are treated here as ‘white-box’ algorithms with traceable links to traditional methods of financial engineering, such as linear regression. In turn, this enables interpretability of neural network algorithms. Also, the book gives a comprehensive description of reinforcement, inverse reinforcement, and Q-learning, supplemented by numerous illustrative materials, as well as the Python code. There is no doubt in our minds that these advanced ML approaches will become a routine in the arsenal of the future quantitative finance!Finally, we want to highlight our favorite part of this book, described in its final chapters. It relates to the classic concept of bounded rationality of financial agents that was introduced by Simon over 60 years ago. As we learned years back and are re-learning today, the real financial markets are populated with very heterogeneous types of investors. As a result, proper modeling of the financial markets and dynamics thereof requires sophisticated and more nuanced approaches. These approaches can be “borrowed” from diverse areas, including physics in general and modern physics in particular. Also, these new approaches will benefit from the interplay between “classic” ML methods, like unsupervised and supervised learning, and “newer” methods, like reinforcement and inverse reinforcement, information-based G-learning, and tensor networks. We strongly support the authors’ notion that these approaches constitute a very promising future of ML applications in finance in general and financial planning and decision-making in particular.Natali Kolker & Eugene Kolker, PhD",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Finance: From Theory to Practice
"This book makes me envious of today’s students—it contains an impressive breadth of material, carefully selected, pedagogically presented, furnished with concrete practical examples and accompanied with working code.  The authors have clearly put in a lot of thought and time in the exposition of the material, its sequence and volume.  The introductory concepts are developed by evolving familiar examples from previous sections.  Especially valuable is the authors’ patient and diligent inclusion of figures, graphics and schematics adding visual illustration of the concepts in the text.  Because of this and the chosen pedagogical style the text never feels dry and abstract, despite the seriously advanced topics that it covers.  The book is actually refreshingly concise, given the scope of topics and the volume of examples and exercises.  The added downloadable code certainly helps with that.The book is, however, not just a good modern exposition of Bayesian principles, advanced neural networks and reinforcement learning, not to mention tools from modern field theory such as tensor train.  It is a specialized monograph building up a practical toolset for using these methods for financial mathematics and engineering.  And it does it in a much-needed maverick way, pointing out the flawed foundations of orthodox derivatives principles.  This part of the book should be noted carefully not only by students, but by academics and practitioners.  For me personally, as a practicing derivatives quant, it inspires the urge to search for alternative options models building on the QLBS and QED ideas, presented in the book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning in Finance: From Theory to Practice

"Machine Learning with Amazon SageMaker Cookbook is a must-have book for data science/machine learning practitioners. Its content is very comprehensive as it covers ML implementations from easy to intermediate level, ranging from regression/classification to computer vision, NLP, and transfer learning on AWS. Besides, I appreciate the fact that this book was published relatively recently and that its code examples are easily executable based on the latest version of Amazon SageMaker (I am sure you understand the frustration of reading a techie book whose code examples are outdated that you must spend a lot of time on debugging). I also appreciate the fact that there are explanations to literally every line of the codes presented in this book so that I didn’t get confused and lost as I was trying out the codes in my machine. Here, I do have a suggestion to the potential readers: as AWS SageMaker has so many features and functionalities that even if this book has done its best in explaining most of them, I still find it hard to absorb all the concepts and methodologies at once; so I find it helpful to, instead of using this book as a textbook (like you need to understand almost everything to a point that you can pass the exam), use it as a dictionary to your day-to-day DS/ML practice, i.e. you can quickly skim through this book several times to have an idea of what each section of each chapter is about and what problem it teaches to solve, and then when you come across a problem in practice, you can quickly locate the relevant section in the book and attempt the codes directly.

"Amazon Sagemaker (and ML in general) can be intimidating to study. While the docs of AWS are helpful, it does not do much in helping you connect ML concepts with each Sagemaker feature. This book fills that gap by combing through features of Sagemaker and explaining the what (the feature does), the when (to use), the how (to use in Sagemaker), and the why (do we need to do this and what happens if we don't).Even if the reader does not have in-depth knowledge of ML concepts, he/she can use this book to get started right away. The book teaches ML concepts as it uses Sagemaker features. As a recipe book, it has dozens of recipes to teach (and also show) these features. What I like about this book is that it also explains the ""why do we need to do this"" behind the feature, something a lot of books in ML have skimped on.I recommend this book to any developer, data scientist or ML enthusiast who would want to learn and use one of the richest ML services out there, SageMaker.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with Amazon SageMaker Cookbook: 80 proven recipes for data scientists and developers to perform machine learning experiments and deployments

"Man kann auf jeden Fall sagen, dass dieses Buch sehr gut geschrieben ist -- leider keine Selbstverständlichkeit. Mathematisch ist es nicht immer ganz rigoros unterwegs, bewegt sich aber auf einem immer noch hohen Standard.Meine erste Wahl als Lehrbuch wäre es nicht, denn es behandelt viele Themen gar nicht oder nicht tief genug, die Stoffauswahl ist oft etwas eigenwillig und für meinen Geschmack holt der Autor manchmal einfach zu weit aus. Hier ziehe ich bei den meisten Themen die neue Auflage vom Murphy vor. Den Titel ""A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective"" kann ich nicht ganz nachvollziehen, bayesianische Methoden werden eigentlich kaum behandelt, der probabilistische Ansatz wird nicht sonderlich hervorgehoben und auch Optimierungstheorie kommt kaum vor. Sehr interessant ist allerdings die Perspektive auf adaptive konvexe Optimierungsmethoden, das habe ich so noch in keinem anderen Lehrbuch gesehen.Unerwartet extrem hilfreich finde ich das umfangreiche Kapitel zu Deep Learning. Dieses stellt auch anspruchsvolle Themen wie z.B. LSTMs oder Variational Autoencoders sehr gut da (auch wenn in der Grafik zu ersterem Thema meiner Meinung nach ein paar Pfeile in die falsche Richtung zeigen...). Hierfür finde ich dieses Buch oft nützlicher als das Standardwerk von Goodfellow et al.Für ein allgemeines, mathematisch rigoroses Lehrbuch zu Machine Learning würde ich eher den neuen Murphy (bisher jedenfalls den ersten Teil) oder ""Data Science and Machine Learning"" von Kroese et al. empfehlen (ersteres ist umfassender, letzteres für den Einstieg besser).",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective

If you are like me, someone that already have experience in Oil & Gas and is moving yourself into Data Science you maybe will agree that the worse part of this path is to realize where and how exactly you will use Machine Learning it Oil Industry. To realize the potential and the possibilities take times because every single course in any place you going to learn Data Science is not using Oil & Gas data, it is always about Financial, health, marketing, HR, and other so common topics where ML and AI has been applied. What Hoss and Alireza has created with this book is a unique master peace for you to fill home, use the data that you already know and apply DS, ML, AI using those data and see the magic of both area cross it other. I can't explain to you how excited I'm and how incredible has been this experience.I also want to add something you need to know. Right now, when I'm writing this review, I'm working in a personal project, something similar that was presented on Chapter 5 in the book but in a large scale. I got stuck searching to the original source of the data in order to get more data from other open source information for different wells. Because I was stuck I decided to text Mr. Hoss and he was so kind and so helpful to point me the right directions. This, for me, has no price and I really with like to thank you Mr Hoss and Alireza for this amazing contribution.The knowledge you both concatenated in this book has been my real guide for a new level on my journey to use ML and AI into Oil & Gas industry. Thank you.PS.: If you all look in the pictures you will see I actually bought both, the digital and paper version of it and I have no regrets, it worth every single dollar I paid for it.Enjoy your reading time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning Guide for Oil and Gas Using Python: A Step--Step Breakdown with Data Algorithms Codes and Applications

"I'm using this book for a Data Mining class in grad. school. I'd never taken a data mining course. Considering that it was a brand new topic to me, I'd say that I've come a long. Granted, I have a great professor, but the textbook deserves a lot of credit too. It explains all of the steps in the Knowledge Discovery/Data Mining process and some key techniques in a way that left me feeling confident and wanting to learn more.The author(s) did a great job of explaining complex topics. It's a textbook, so there's a good combination of both theory and math. I like the way that the book uses one company as the focus of examples for the entire book. It's creates continuity. I will admit that there are a few points where the author assumes that the reader knows a math concept and doesn't explain it, but overall, if you have at least an introductory level knowledge of statistics, you'll be fine. .",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)

"The content of the book seems pretty good.  I have only got up to about chapter four so far and it's easy to read and introduces material in a reasonably gentle manner.  The three stars are due to the fact that I am using the electronic version, on a kindle app on an Android tablet, and it has some issues.  It is mostly OK but suffers because quite a lot of the technical material is scanned rather than true font or vector which means that if you zoom in, the surrounding text gets bigger but the figures, formula and diagrams often don't.  This is particularly troublesome for mathematical formulas which are sometimes scanned at quiet low resolution and very difficult to decipher, not great when they are already quite complex to understand.It's usable though, much more convenient in electronic form and I've saved myself about $50 by renting the book on Amazon for four months compared to buying it at the Uni bookshop.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)

"In the chapter of the introduction, the author says the book is primarily about asset pricing. The “asset pricing” here refers to complicated and abstract mathematical models used in academicians. These models plainly complicate the concepts that are already known to us. For practitioners, the models will not give them an insightful idea and an intuitive understanding of how the modern financial market works.The book also does not have program codes, the necessary materials that a modern learning book should have.

As a relatively experienced data scientist, the latter half that focused on PCA and K-Means was much more useful. Since this book is focused on beginners, it still works well.I, however, do find that this much like many other books in the category today doesn't provide a large enough toolkit or one that is focused on exploring data for deep-learning and more complex modeling applications that beginners are now expected to tackle.

"An invaluable resource to map your ML workflows to the corresponding AWS service offerings.Reading the AWS documentation is confusing at best when you don’t already know what the services do. If you don’t have a good grasp of the various ML processes and steps, you won’t understand the need for all the various services. Bridging this divide is where this book really shines.AWS presents you with the options of using the CLI, SDKs, CDK, templates like Cloudformation, or the console, to create the resources you will need. This is overwhelming unless you are a DevOps expert. This book is packed with simple, straight forward, screenshots with arrows, of the step by step process of what to click and what the configuration means. Eventually you’ll want to graduate to infrastructure as code via one of the options I just mentioned, but this book provides the initial momentum you’ll need when starting. And just saying “starting” doesn’t do this book justice as by the end you will actually be able to run an end-to-end production ML system which will absolutely scale to workloads that are only seen at the largest of companies.One shortcoming of this book is If you are already using some open source products e.g. apache airflow, kafka, MLFlow, etc and looking to replace them with the AWS equivalent then unfortunately you won’t find any comparisons or pros/cons. For example if you are using airflow as a data pipeline then you can just go straight to chapter 11 on “pipelines”. But if you later find out that you relied on some feature from the open source project that doesn’t have an obvious label like “pipeline” you will spend some time trying to find the equivalent functionality if it even exists.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting Started with Amazon SageMaker Studio: Learn to build end-to-end machine learning projects in the SageMaker machine learning IDE

"As a data analyst looking to expand my data engineering skills, I have been looking for a book on this topic for a while now. It's exactly what I needed to better understand how to write ETL jobs using GCP.The code in Github has a few errors, but if you know basic Python you should be able to spot and correct the mistakes fairly easily. Overall, this books has helped me a ton. I would definitely purchase it again.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Engineering with Google Cloud Platform: A practical guide to operationalizing scalable data analytics systems on GCP
"Let me present for your consideration my review of Data Engineering with Google Cloud Platform, by Adi Wijaya. Data Engineering with Google Cloud Platform explores the transformative family of Google Cloud Platform data tools, which according to the respective business use case may comprise of numerous varied configurations.Attentive to the varied and diverse situations that might inspire one to pick up this text, Adi Wijaya introduces useful frameworks and patterns which, together with choice examples which do not overburden the reader but illuminate key chokepoints and decision points in the construction of a unified and flexible data processing system. On the critical questions – batch vs. stream to the uninitiated, DataFlow vs DataProc, Adi Wijawa presents both – electing to provide the fullest context possible to the reader, that a decision on critical data infrastructure and organization might be attained organically. Confronted by these and more dichotomies, Adi Wijawa eschews judgment in favor of presenting a more complete context – introducing legacy processing paradigms, (hello, DataProc) alongside those options which we dreamers might aspire to build the future. I speak here of DataFlow and Pub/Sub – yes, but also of Kubernetes and infrastructure as code – two areas which, though not within the core functions of Data Engineer, are important.Machine Learning Operations – which concerns itself with the managing of multiple machine learning models running in production – is gently introduced and masterfully interwoven within the final section of the tex. The 8th chapter of the text, “Building Machine Learning Solutions on Google Cloud Platform”, introduces the reader to Google’s powerful Vertex AI – built atop KubeFlow pipelines, which introduces the reader to machine learning on Kubernetes. The 8th chapter is outstanding – and while Adi Wijaya qualifies the importance of machine learning to a Data Engineer, he does not shortchange the subject, offering an exciting deployment of a scikit-learn pipeline according to the very best practices of Google Machine Learning and Google Data Engineering practices.Despite its daring scope, Data Engineering with Google Cloud Platform is an unqualified success – a must-read for anyone hoping to work with data at scale. As a Google Certified Professional Data Engineer I can very easily recommend this work – not only to anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of big data, cloud computing, and in particular, Google Cloud, but also to anyone who has not yet realized that their machine learning problems are actually data engineering problems in disguise.At the end of the day, you will choose a data solution or a data architecture, and attend to the consequences. I urge you to follow Adi Wijaya’s advice, to keep abreast and keep aware of the trends that Adi Wijaya hints play an outsized role upon the role of the data engineer.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Engineering with Google Cloud Platform: A practical guide to operationalizing scalable data analytics systems on GCP

"Google Cloud Platform had always been pioneered when it comes to big data and AI. This platform is amazingly simple for developers and the author has done a great job putting everything together step by step to facilitate readers' and users' experience.The book is divided into 12 solid chapters; the last chapter is related to those who are interested in getting certification and want to know more about it.[Chapter 1 ] - Explains fundamentals of data engineering, ETL concept in data engineering and data life cycle, the difference between ETL and ELT, etc. It also explains ETL, big data, and distributed systems in short.[Chapter 2] - This is more related to big data products and their capability, GCP console, cloud shell, and cloud editor are needed and explained in detail with other associated services. The author has explained serverless services or fully managed services. Most of the cloud companies want clients/users to be on and opt serverless side of the story![Chapter 3] - Cover Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery console, Different kind of scenarios the author has presented give a different aspect of the data modeling and understanding of the BigQuery operations. You will learn design data modeling for BigQuery. Diagram and code to cover your practice that is your key.[Chapter 4] - In this chapter automating tasks, jobs, and how to handle their dependencies has been explained.  Cloud Composer, the introduction of the open-source tool “Airflow” and data pipeline for BigQuery data warehouse. [Chapter 5] - If you know and have an idea about Spark and PySpark you will be enjoying this chapter! Developing Spark ETL from GCS to BigQuery is a fun part. Brief Intro to Dataproc which is Data Lake, building a data lake on a Dataproc cluster, creating and running jobs on a Dataproc cluster, the concept of the ephemeral cluster, using Dataproc and Cloud Composer is explained. My suggestion is to learn HDFS and Spark a bit in detail, this is an important chapter.[Chapter 6] – You will learn about streaming data and how to handle incoming data as soon as data is created using the Pub/Sub publisher client.[Chapter 7] - Data Studio for visualizing data with connectivity to BigQuery. Data studio explorer gives a lot of options to make charts/aggregations and visualize your data.[Chapter 8] - No one understands better than Google Cloud about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.  In this chapter, author has a provided bird eye view of ML, MLOps, some pre-built GCP models as a service, and deploying ML pipelines with Vertex AI are highlights. If you like ML you will be enjoying this chapter. Different Exercises make this a more fun chapter. [Chapter 9 ]  IAM, project structure, and BigQuery ACLs, controlling user access/ infrastructure as code. You will also learn the power of Terraform but my intake is practicing “Terraform” a bit outside of this book is more fun and you will see new challenges. [Chapter 10]  - This chapter cover cost strategy/saving money and also highlights how to estimate the overall data solution using GCP. End-to-end data solution cost with tools and tips for optimizing services. Happy clients bring good business![Chapter 11] - Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) on Google Cloud Platform for Data Engineers, explains the concept of CI/CD and its relevance to data engineers. Without CI/CD cloud is like a handicap! If you have used that before you will understand its importance.[Chapter 12 ] – As I explained in the beginning it's all about Boosting Your Confidence as a Data Engineer, and preparing you for the GCP certification. Finally, I would conclude it as a great book. Nice references/URL and summary for revision.For a new version of the book, I would be expecting more questions and case studies for readers.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Engineering with Google Cloud Platform: A practical guide to operationalizing scalable data analytics systems on GCP
"Data Engineering with GCP by Adi Wijaya is a hands-on-book that covers processes such as Data Warehousing , ETL/ELT, and workflow management through the use of Google Cloud Platform's tech stack.Services such as IAM & Admin, BigQuery, CloudSQL, Cloud Storage, Composer, Dataproc, Pub/Sub, and Dataflow are covered in multiple chapters of the book with hands-on or coding examples through Cloud Console,  Cloud Shell scripting, and even Python code. Most examples are presented by trying to answer business requirements for real world scenarios.What I specifically liked is that the author also covers the concepts around data engineering processes such as comparing the Inmon and Kimball Data Warehousing methods and when to use each as well as user and project management and the optimal cost strategy when using the tools provided by GCP.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Engineering with Google Cloud Platform: A practical guide to operationalizing scalable data analytics systems on GCP

"I recently successfully passed the AWS machine learning specialty exam and used this book in preparing for the exam.  The book is well written and helpful in preparing for the exam.  This exam tests your knowledge of machine learning and your ability to develop and implement viable predictive modelling solutions. In my opinion, it is not a substitute for experience designing ML solutions.  I recommend additional resources be utilized to adequately prepare for the exam.  For example, the book does not get into the mathematics of the ML models.  It also does not cover any of the ML frameworks in detail and assumes the reader has practical experience. Setting up an AWS account and going through tutorials of the various models will help fill that gap.

"I like the book. It explains things adequately. The representations take a little bit to digest. I think that the field is more difficult than it needs to be. This is mostly because math is one of the most convoluted areas in education. IF we scrapped all of that crap about the names, and worked with names that had logical connections, then the learning would be greatly enhanced. As it is, when you want to learn the fundamentals of math, you are required to learn math history. We teach about some people as if they are extraordinary - as if no one else is working on the same things. But the first person to cross the finish line shall be immortalized like a god. This book is full of those references, but that is at least what I was looking for. Since that is how the world works, it makes some of the communications easier if we understand this convolution. I mean, a Kalman filter is really only a control system feedback loop of a Bayes equation. If you don't know about those people, then this book is either ripe for the reading, or a little bit out of reach. I am by no means claiming talent at taking these abstract ideas and presenting them in an easily consumable fashion. I would say that a class on Abstract ABC's so to speak would allow us to speak in a more abstract fashion and approach math form its constituent parts when building an algorithm. If anything, the symbolic crafting in this book (and the changes detailing how the symbolic representations have changed) is priceless. It details how refactoring can make things more understandable. Unfortunately, it is only done as a means of representing the author's work (which is the intent). I long for the author that is willing to rewrite the formulas, perhaps using artificial intelligence to compile optimal absorption. Until then, anyone learning more about math history than math will never be a leader in math. At some point, there are enough names to overload a lifetime of learning. This necessitates a simpler approach equivalent to the building blocks of atoms. Then, you learn how the relationship of the pieces affects the whole. I understand that mathematicians who are publishing new materials must arrive there, I just don't think that the process of getting there needs to be so difficult. Keep math history as a class called math history. Let math be just that - math.I included the rant as a reason why I liked this book. Revising the notation leaves me with hope that we will develop better means of conveying the pieces comprising the models that allow us to expand our imaginations on what is possible. It could be written with much more clarity and readability, but I think that will have to wait until we develop better semantics of mathematical expression.

"I read the entire book cover to cover, doing every (non-programming) exercise, as part of a PhD involving RL. I was also familiar with the first edition (1998).The 2nd edition (2018) has been entirely reworked; it is much longer, the structure has changed, the notation has changed, many new topics are discussed. Same as the first edition, the second edition is both a reference book and a pedagogic manual. The main differences are:(1) Part I, which deals with the fundamentals of RL in a simplified setting, is carefully worded in order to convey understanding in the same accessible, intuitive manner as in the first edition, but also paying closer attention to mathematical rigor and systematicity.(2) Part II, which deals with RL with function approximation, is at times somewhat involved mathematically compared to the first edition, reflecting the general evolution of the field of Machine Learning. The most difficult sections are clearly marked as such, and can be skipped. But taking on the difficulties straight on is always (positively) rewarding, in the end.(3) Part III deals with related developments in psychology and neuroscience, which are a welcome addition to a field that has branched across disciplines. This should be useful to neuroscientists and computational neuroscientists, as well as to experimental/cognitive psychologists.Many exercises are included. I am no math buff and found that I could do every single one of them on my own, which is unfortunately not usually the case in other A.I. books. These exercises serve to help the reader understand key issues by working them out for themselves, in a guided manner; they make self-study possible and enjoyable.This is an indispensable book for anybody working in RL. My only issue is that I'm too late to be referenced in it, but I haven't lost hope of making it in the 3rd edition, which is expected in 2038.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reinforcement Learning second edition: An Introduction (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)

"Passionate exposition on effective visualizations. Key takeaways are small-multiples, use of color, and use of details. However, the material on maps is sketchy. While mostly good, it is also distractedly didactic. While a must-have in any collection on data visualizations, for people looking for only one book on effective data visualizations, this is not it.This book is like the poetry of visualizations; you will need to supplement it with books that are the prose of visualizations - see suggestions at the end of the review.Why 3 Stars???--------------I initially gave this four stars, but then changed it to three stars. This may seem harsh, but hear me out. There is lots that is good in the book. However, this book's focus is more on cartography and maps. And this is where it falls short. It does not address the issue of map based visualizations in any sort of depth. Not much space is devoted to the different types of map based visualizations - dot plots, qualitative and quantitative choropleths (color patches), heatmaps, proportional bars, 3D maps, maps with variable sized markers, isopleths, flow maps, dot-location maps, graduated symbol maps, and much, much, more. The other reason for deducting two stars is the fact that this book, in 2009, does read a bit dated. It is a beautifully laid out book, that almost falls into the coffee-table book category, but looking beyond that, the material does show its age. 10 or 15 years ago the rating would have been 4 or 5 stars. Perhaps unfair on my part...Excerpt:-------On the topic of spatial maps, Tufte highlights a problem that may emerge with conventional choropleths (blot maps): ""(they)... paint over areas formed by given geographic or political boundaries ..."" and resulting in non-uniform sizes, and ""historical changes in political boundaries disrupt continuity of statistical comparisons."" The solution? Or at least one solution: ""Mesh maps finesse these problems."" Taking the example of a map of Japan, ""... the whole country of Japan was divided up in 379,000 equal-sized units and then, in a heroic endeavor, census data and addresses were collated to match the new grid squares."" [page 40, 41]Some of the examples may not strike a resonant chord with everyone - for example, the ""Weather Chart"" at the top of page 32 looks too dense and full of diverse symbols to be truly effective.Excerpts from the book:-----------------------""All communication between the readers of an image and the makers of an image must now take place on a two-dimensional surface. Escaping this flatland is the essential task of envisioning information."" [page 12]Given the inherent multi-dimensionality of data (a measure that represents value or values over time, region, and other dimensions - e.g. number of employees by year, by country, and by line-of-business), Tufte states that we should ""... increase (1) the number of dimensions that can be represented on plane surfaces and (2) the data density (amount of information per unit area)."" [page 13]This focus on data density finds resonance throughout the book:""Simplicity of reading derives from the context of detailed and complex information, properly arranged. A most unconventional design strategy is revealed: to clarify, add detail."" [page 37]Tufte is especially harsh on charts that feature ""chart junk"", what he describes as ""... display apparatus and ornamentation""  that ""... seek to attract and divert attention..."", and that ""Lurking behind chart junk is contempt both for information and for the audience. ... designing as if readers were obtuse and uncaring... "" [page 33, 34]""The struggle between maintenance of context and enforcement of comparison... "" [page 77]Excessive or wanton use of color can be very damaging to the visualization. Eduard Imhof enumerates four rules of minimizing such color damage:""First rule: Pure, bright colors or very strong colors have loud, unbearable effects when they stand unrelieved over large areas adjacent to each other, but extraordinary effects can be achieved when they are used sparingly on or between dull background tones. ...Second rule: The placing of light, bright colors mixed with white next to each other usually produces unpleasant results..."" [page 82]Tufte lists ""... the fundamental uses of color in information design: to label (color as noun), to measure (color as quantity), to represent or intimate reality (color as representation), and to enliven or decorate (color as beauty)."" [page 81]Cons:-----The book is short. It doesn't feel so, but is in fact all of 126 pages.More color is needed.Some of the reproductions are not very clear, and it is a real strain on the eyes to discern the data and the visualization: certainly not a ringing endorsement for a book on visualizations.Without some any formal, theoretical background, this book feels incomplete.In Closing:-----------Consider this: while you may use other books more frequently to learn and reference when creating visualizations, charts, or dashboards, you will want to keep this book handy to remind yourself of the bigger picture and the historical context of visualizations.Suggested Additional Reading:-----------------------------You should supplement the visual feast in Tufte's ""Envisioning Information"" with these books:- Tufte's other book, 
The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 2nd edition

"You'll find Tufte's name in the references in the back of almost every data visualization book out there. And while he has written several books, from what I can tell Envisioning Information is the favorite among readers (if by a slim margin).The author's Yale professorship, Phi Beta Kappa label, design awards and science-focused edge all testify that he knows what he's talking about. But the real strength of the book in my opinion is that anyone with any level of knowledge on the topic of data visualization(beginner to advanced) can appreciate the book.I'm a relative beginner with data visualization and, as experts seem to like the book so much, I was expecting very theory-based, slightly pedantic textbook content. Instead, I found the book easy to read, relying heavily on examples that became ""food for thought"" - Japanese cartography, train schedules, scientific experiments - you name it.Other books I've read on the topic have casually thrown out unnecessary ""fluff"" examples to partially illustrate a point; Tufte's examples build carefully on top of the points his words have already clearly illustrated. It's precisely this ""food for thought"" feeling that makes me think I'll return to Envisioning Information for reference in the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Envisioning Information
"This is a short book, 126 pages. An interesting cursory exploration of the subject. However, it feels like it predates information technology (1990 predates the web by 5 years), and seems to have more in common with how to communicate elements of a hand-drawn map atlas if you were living in the 1700s than it has with using Adobe Illustrator to convey an idea for the web. I bought this book to see if it would help me as a web developer, and instead when it arrived I realized I got a weird coffee table book that feels like it was written in the 1960s, at the latest, to summarize that you can use different icons or pictographs of small size to communicate important ideas without words. (Sorry, I already gave away the story of the book.)I know this review isn't going to get very popular marks, but, put simply, this book is probably good for professional or student pure designers, but it's useless for me. I honestly don't think the book targets web designers, but somebody here reviewed that it was ""great"" for web designers, so because of that remark I bought it.

Edward R Tufte is a forward-thinking college professor who teaches courses with the kind of information provided in this book. Very well presented and each illustration or diagram deserves to be carefully inspected (use a magnifying glass!) because this is real information in a clearly understandable format.

High-quality book to be read-through again and again! Examples of work range from ancient solutions to more modern from many different cultures to overlap and emphasize problem-solving and innovation.One sour note is that when I received it in the mail the book needed to be aired-out due to a strange and funky odor that I think originated in the inks and paper.

"As a coffee table book, Envisioning Information is gorgeous. You will behold luscious colors, faithfully reproduced images with fine detail, and a fine collection of some of the best and worst of informative graphics. It's a splendid portfolio of some ingenious visual displays of complex information.For theoreticians, it's a mind-jogger and demands a critical review of how you display information today. Are we being demanding enough? Simple enough? Clear enough? There is more than one way to display information and this portfolio challenges us to think harder.As a practial guide, however, this tome is slim. It's a quick read - I went through it briskly in about two hours. And it does contain a few useful nuggets, especially the before-and-after images showing how too much color, over-heavy borders and other thoughtless ornamentation detracts from the information. However, it was not enough for me.

"As someone who has been doing ML DevOps for 15 years (although they were called 'statistical' and 'predictive' models back in the day...not 'machine learning' models like they are now) for startups to Fortune 500 companies, I keep up with all deployment trends. Usually when new paradigms emerge on the radar, I run to O'Reilly and hit the books. I did this successfully with R, Python, Spark ML, Sagemaker, etc.....Kubeflow was no different.I was impressed with this book because Kubeflow is actually an ecosystem of tools and philosophies, and I haven't seen them all documented cleanly all in one place - especially with the backing compute layer (Docker / Kubernetes) taken into account. The chapter where all this is diagrammed out, and how what role each play is worth the (reasonable!) price of this book. Much quicker way to learn KF then trying to read a bunch of disjoint blog posts that are only talking about their little corner of the ML devops world.This book will also start conditioning you to start thinking in terms of deployment pipelines - probably the most important ML devops paradigms to emerge over the past 3-4 years. Get in on the ground floor now and evolve as the technology and patterns become more complex from here!If your goal is to learn enough about Kubeflow to start tinkering and hold a meaningful conversation with the seasoned experts without coming off like a n00b, or if your goal is to learn enough to compare / contrast Kubeflow against Sagemaker or Spark ML Flow for architecture debates, this is the book for you.My only criticism:  the tone shifted between chapter 2 - where they talk you through setting up your own Kubeflow environment - to chapter 3 where they start talking about using KF with the cloud providers. I didn't realize they shifted at first and was confused. No biggie, I guess that is what happens when five authors contribute to a 200 page book!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kubeflow for Machine Learning: From Lab to Production
"The authors are early adopters of Kubernetes and as the ecosystem continues to evolve, they have written about Kubeflow, providing good examples on how to jump start your journey into ML and Kubernetes.Perfect for those who are just starting to do more with Kubernetes and want to evolve their ML/Analytics workflow.The book is well organized and is written for those who want to learn Kubernetes and Kubeflow for practical use.

"In my opinion, this book should be a required read for anyone of any level and in any position in the software development/engineering field. This book teaches so many solid and timeless principles that could possibly take years or decades for the average person to learn, if ever.Before reading this book, I didn't know where I stood as a developer after 15 years of doing it. I'm self-taught, and also learned from my surroundings, assuming that people in higher positions than me must know better - now I never assume anything about anyone or anything. I never got much (useful) feedback but I wanted to be as good as I could be in my field. Reading this book and applying what I learned from it eventually lead to a great confidence in my way of problem solving and coding, and this confidence naturally caused me to be happier, and that's when I realized that when I'm confident and happy I produce my best work that I'm proud of. Not only do I feel like I have leveled up as a software engineer, but I also feel like I leveled up as a person. I also feel validated for a few things I was already doing, and learned that soft skills (communication, accountability, etc) are just as important as hard skills (coding).I've already convinced at least 3 developers to buy their own copy, and I'm about to suggest it to a few more, so I think I need to look up some kind of referral/commission program.This book is worth every penny and has me going back to it for reference all the time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery 20th Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition)
"This is what I call a “peas and carrots” book. It’s not a bad book and it’s hard to argue with anything the authors advocate, but to me it’s a lot like a self-help book in that people will feel good while reading it (and thus rate it highly) but in the end a lot of people will not actually follow the material and unless you’re a newbie a whole lot of it will be pretty obvious. I know this because I’ve been working in the software industry for 20 years and this is hailed as a classic, yet people continue to make the same mistakes. This isn’t the book’s fault really, but I also feel like the book covers a lot without saying much at all. It’s similar to a self-help book for people who are feeling down, they might feel good reading it but does it really genuinely help you in the end? I suppose that depends on the person.Don’t repeat yourself (DRY), always be learning, be mindful of how you name your variables, avoid code rot, don’t over-engineer, don’t make excuses when you mess up, write unit tests, use version control, avoid global variables, use properties or getter/setter methods, work well with others, refactor your code when needed, break down complex problems into smaller more digestible chunks, double-check emails before sending them, etc etc. These are the concepts this book talks about.This is more a “why” book and less a “how” book. It does talk about the hows from a birds-eye perspective but it never really digs deep into any particular topic, rather it uses (well written) flowery language to say a lot without saying a whole lot. I really feel like this type of book, for the most part, could be distilled down into a couple pages of bullet points and not lose too much effect. It is well written though, so it’s kinda fun to read in a feel-good sense.There are good nuggets of information in this book and some topics are covered a bit more in depth than others, but in the end I think you will feel good while reading it because it is easy to read and agree with it, especially for a book focused on programming, but I don’t think you’ll come out of it leveling up your skills, especially if you’re experienced. Despite people saying that this is a book for all levels, I feel like you’ll get more out of it if you’re a new developer. For experienced developers, as I mentioned, it will serve as a gentle reminder of what you should do, even if you don’t follow the advice given when you’re finished with the book.One thing worth mentioning is that I purchased the Kindle version and it's done proper.

"Before commenting on the contents of Automated Machine Learning on AWS, I must express how much I have to appreciate the fact that this book was newly published. As web services like AWS change the UIs or features of some of its services fairly frequently, this book’s examples manage to provide accurate hands-on instructions to toggling the relevant AWS services. Content-wise, the book is structured in a progressive manner. It first introduces how to perform CRISP-DM methodology using AutoPilot and AutoGluon, and introduces their pros and cons. Then, in section 2, it provides solutions to address the cons of the solutions mentioned in section 1, along with introducing the concepts and hands-ons for CI/CD methodology. As the topics progress further, more AWS solutions are mentioned tailored to different DS/ML development styles. So far I’ve read over half of the book and have felt more confident exercising my MLOps in the workplace. I would recommend this book for DS and MLE who wants to explore more cloud solutions for end-to-end ML projects. However, it might be a bit challenging for readers who have no prior experience with AWS and the common ML deployment tools such as Docker and Kubernetes. Fortunately, the author has kindly provided links whenever there are new AWS services or concepts being introduced, to facilitate our learning. It is daunting to learn ML deployment, but with the help of Automated Machine Learning on AWS, the journey will be easier.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Automated Machine Learning on AWS: Fast-track the development of your production-ready machine learning applications the AWS way
"This is a book review from Packt and it’s a great honor to have received a copy of this book to do a review. I am really grateful that I have been given a great job and a S&P 500 company. At my job, I have had a luck using AWS service professionally which is really great because it definitely relates to what I am doing. In addition, it’s also good to say a few worlds because this is something truly lack of from academia which is something I would definitely be interested in while I was a student.I want to start by thanking Abeer who reach out to me and the author of the book Trenton Potgieter. The author is a senior AI/ML specialist at AWS and he has been working to create multiple ML solutions since 2011. I have had the luck to have used AWS service before so this is truly personal for me as well.As a summary, this book is:> definitely a complete review of how to deploy models on AWS> covers the pros and cons of data science pipelines on both local server and cloud server> introduces detailed pipeline surrounding the topic of data-centric AI> a MUST READ for professionals in data scienceBeing in this field for 5+ years, I have personally experienced the pain to have to train machines in local services. It is cumbersome and usually give me a big headache, because it takes forever and I have to monitor the laptop which makes my workflow extremely inefficient. It’s s fortunate that the author provides systemic materials in this book from introduction to automated machine learning on AWS to deployment of complicated model using AutoGluon on AWS. I have personally experienced some moments of my data science career that has not been designed to optimize my workflow. It is to my surprise that this book is able to address most of these issues from professional point of view but also be able to provide detailed explanation to walk readers through the basic steps such as creating images, deploying repositories, and train machines online.Specifically, when it comes to business case, the book did a great job linking the materials to practical pipeline that might be used in the industry, which I really appreciate. The data science pipeline starts with data and Andrew Ng proposed data-centric AI, which this book also has a chapter elaborating the roles AWS Sagemaker plays in the pipeline. The data leads us and is also something that we babysit or massage. A model is built and R&D period serves as a crucial stage to build the machine learning or deep learning model. The training, when it is with heavy job load, is often deployed on a cloud server. The model itself is stored in a script in an internal network. The script can be called and sent to cloud server where CPU or GPU is allocated and billed on a minute basis. The model, during its training process, is charged with billable minutes. The model evaluation part follows from the model training. Some tasks the model can be evaluated locally. Some tasks the model evaluation can be done online which will also incur billable minutes. The model evaluation is extremely important because it provides hints for us to know where to go from here. The data scientists would need the information from model evaluation to continue the training process. From this stage, a cycle can be established between:  model building <=> model evaluation <=> model tuning. This cycle is commonly known as hyper parameter optimization. If a data scientist wants an efficient and systemic hyperparameter optimization process, a system such as AWS Sagemaker can truly make our lives easier. This book covers a great deal of what the process looks like with and without AWS Sagemaker.Acknowledgement. The opinions in this book review is a reflection of my own experience and mine only.

I was expecting a lot of demonstrations with respect to quantum encodings (e.g. basis, amplitude, angle, sampling), quantum kernels, and training approaches (e.g, variational methods). However the book is really a collection of already available resources. The first 220 pages are stardard introductory material, that you would find in Nielsen and Chuang.

"To this day, I recall the frustration of failing a college course even though I worked hard and wanted to understand the material. The professor certainly seemed very intelligent. Thankfully, I passed after retaking the course a semester later. The difference was another professor who had a gift for explaining complicated material in a way that made sense to me. Jeff Prosise also has that gift.Don't let the book's title scare you into thinking that to understand its concepts, you have to be a nerd in a dark room drinking Mountain Dew until the odd hours of the night tinkering with code (Oh wait, that's me!), or, you have to be a data scientist or have degrees in advanced mathematics. It is approachable and understandable to anyone with a logical mind and the ability to use Google to define some terms that pop up here and there. I really think managers and CxOs who can't see the random forests for the decision trees will benefit the most in getting a grip on what this topic is all about. I will say something that may seem outrageous, but I think many of the readers here who like sci-fi could skip installing and running the code examples and come away being able to determine science fiction from fact in this topic.This book is broken into two parts: part 1 builds foundations, defines terms, and covers traditional machine learning (ML) and part 2 delves further into deep learning and building neural networks. The entire book has wonderful, real-world examples. It uses the most popular tools like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow for building machine learning models. It also uses Python for most code examples with a few things in C# for ML.Net and some client examples.I appreciate the real-world examples like predicting taxicab arrivals or credit fraud that connect with actions people perform day to day. The audio classification example, which uses sound files with a convolutional neural network, is fascinating and creative. The chapters covering facial and object recognition were favorites; I had more than a couple of ""aha"" moments because Jeff did such a great job building on the basics from the beginning. Have you ever wondered how self-driving cars avoid hitting objects? The chapter on Natural Language Processing interested me because I use Duolingo every day in my study of Portuguese as a third language, and I've wondered how the language processor works. Hey, I have a clue now!The book concludes with a tour of Azure Cognitive Services and a final example that is simple and elegant using the Contoso Travel company so many Microsoft developers are familiar with from demos. Speaking of demos, if you want to follow the examples, Jeff has done a great job of explaining how to set up the environment and even created the Docker container image with everything you need to make it simple. I also learned to use Flask to wrap a Python Model in a web service and call it from a C# client. Way cool! Now I can say I'm busy training my model without HR getting upset... but I digress.Thank you, Jeff, for an excellent book!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Applied Machine Learning and AI for Engineers: Solve Business Problems That Cant Be Solved Algorithmically
"While not a full-on linear algebra book (despite the title), this does serve as a perfect undergraduate-level introduction to the Machine Learning galaxy and its many, many applications and increasingly popular methodology. Computer scientists, mathematicians and engineers - as well as math-savvy economists and businesspeople - could benefit from a class using this text or from self-learning if one is not prepared for a classic like Deep Learning.Upsides include a thorough review of linear algebra and a very up-to-date list of data analytic topics that are at the edge of research and recently implemented techniques, including Google's new ranking system, which it continues the recent trend of texts in covering as a side section late in the book. This is a Gil Strang book, which means problems, problems, problems galore (no answers are given within the text). Chapter VI on optimization methodology is the star of this show, and is a really good stepping stone to the higher-level texts on these topics.Downsides include breadth-not-depth coverage and the need for a little bit of organization. There is far more in here for a single class, but it seems like it was written with the purpose to be all or almost all used for a single semester's worth of coursework. This may work for MIT, but not for a second- or third-tier undergraduate department (at least not without significant trouble). Fortunately, an instructor can simply cut some topics, but the students should at least read up on these for the purposes of interest; they are certainly NOT comprehensive introductions - hence, the ""breadth-not-depth"" critique above; see e.g. the Compressed Sensing section for a prime example of ... well, sparsity of information. It could also stand for some significant clean-up and organization.Glibert Strang is well-known in math cirles as an extraordinary innovator and teacher of linear algebra. I found this book from him simply delightful, and, though my needs already exceeded it in general, was surprised on how much I learned from it still.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Linear Algebra and Learning from Data
"This book presents linear algebra in a way that is different from most linear algebra approaches. Although most courses note that a matrix can be decomposed into r (rank of the matrix) outer products of two vectors (matrices of rank 1), this course exploits it to really expose many of the techniques of deep learning and fundamentally explain the factorization of matrices via LU, QR and SVD and circulant matrices.  I rediscovered the factorization of X^N + Y^N quite easily from such techniques. It really helps in understanding many algorithms of ""Numerical Recipes in C"".  The only deficit is that it references so many other sources rather than expostulating the technique itself. Although in its defense, if it did, the book would be too heavy to carry.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Linear Algebra and Learning from Data
I learned Linear Algebra in college like every other engineering student and didn't really understand what it was useful for other than solving systems of equations with a computer.

"Prof Strang has been writing intoductory linear algebra books since the mid nineteen seventies. All of them good. In this book he sharply departs from his own and ever other book in introductory presentation and presents the outer product at the same level of detail as the inner product.  This clarifies many applications, by allowing discussion of rank one corrections in applications. I really like this.  For me it was late undergraduate or early graduate school that the outer and inner product became peer in the type of applications that I was interested in.  While this book has an eye towards “machine learning,” it is very clear that Prof Strang sees all applications as data science.  This book is his distillation of that. I wish I’d had this at the beginning of my education. This was a wonderful reintroduction to a view I use everyday.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Linear Algebra and Learning from Data

"At the end of the preview, the book recommends converting song listening counts into  a binary 0 1 variable. This is TERRIBLE advice. It mentions binning as an alternative but goes ahead with binary code. The authors argument is that ""listening 10 times does not mean liking the song as much as someone who listens ,,20 times.""In other words, if the user listened to a song at least once, then we count it as the user liking the song. This way, the model will not need to spend cycles on predicting the minute differences between the raw counts. The binary target is a simple and robust measure of user preference."".  There are many ways to deal with possible non-proportional effects. Going to a 1 treats someone who tried a song and did not like it the same as someone who listens daily!I would love a good book on this topic for my students, but this is not it..",2.0 out of 5 stars,Feature Engineering for Machine Learning: Principles and Techniques for Data Scientists

This is not meant for someone that has advanced mathematical background and intuitions, but I believe they too would benefit from the clarity this book adds.

They introduce the concepts very well before moving into the specifics of the logic and math behind the algorithms.

"Machine learning and security are all the rage. With the RSA Conference a little more than 2 weeks away, there will be plenty of firms on the expo floor touting their security solutions based on AI, deep learning, and machine learning.In Machine Learning and Security: Protecting Systems with Data and Algorithms, authors Clarence Chio and David Freeman have written a no-nonsense technical and practical guide showing how you can avoid that hype, and truly use machine learning to enhance information security.After a brief introduction to what machine learning is, the authors candidly write of the limitations of machine learning in security. They note that the notion that machine learning methods will always give good results across different use cases is categorically false. In real-world scenarios there are usually factors to optimize for other than precision recall or accuracy.For those that think that machine learning is the latest information security silver bullet, as good as this book is, it certainly won’t help them. But for those that know the limitations of machine learning, the authors suggest approaching it with equal parts enthusiasm and caution, remembering that not everything can instantly be made better with machine learning.Machine learning works alongside areas such as pattern recognition and computational statistics, and as such, the book is made for those with a strong background in programming, math, and statistics. Most of the programming samples are in Python.Current technologies like malware and virus classification, intrusion detection, malware classification, network protocol analysis and more are imperfect science. The promise of machine learning comes with many challenges. For those who are willing to invest in doing that, Machine Learning and Security is an indispensable reference.This is a serious book for those serious about integrating machine learning into the overall information security framework. The reader is expected to know the underlying mathematics and statistics, Python and other languages, and more importantly – how to integrate these into their security architecture. Titles like Machine Learning For Dummies may provide a good introduction to the topic, but it’s books like this that will take you there.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning and Security: Protecting Systems with Data and Algorithms

"Unlike many (most?) books and courses on machine learning, Barber's outstanding text is very suitable for self study. There are many reasons for this, and high among them is the fact that he carefully explains, with commonsense examples and applications, many of the tougher logical, mathematical and processing foundations of pattern recognition.For relative beginners, Bayesian techniques began in the 1700s to model how a degree of belief should be modified to account for new evidence. The techniques and formulas were largely discounted and ignored until the modern era of computing, pattern recognition and AI, now machine learning. The formula answers how the probabilities of two events are related when represented inversely, and more broadly, gives a precise mathematical model for the inference process itself (under uncertainty), where deductive reasoning and logic becomes a subset (under certainty, or when values can resolve to 0/1 or true/false, yes/no etc. In ""odds"" terms (useful in many fields including optimal expected utility functions in decision theory), posterior odds = prior odds * the Bayes Factor.For context, I'm the lead scientist at IABOK dot org-- we design algorithms for huge data mining problems and applications. This text is our ""go to"" reference for programmers not up to speed in many of the new pattern recognition algorithms, including those writing new versions. All the most recent relevant models, from a probability standpoint, are represented here, with a clarity that is stunning. My only criticism (a mild one) is that, when applying Barber's examples to Bodies of Knowledge and data mining, he skips Prolog, backward chaining, predicate calculus and other techniques that are the foundation of automated inference systems (systems that extend knowledge bases automatically by checking whether new propositions can be inferred from the KB as consistent, relevant, etc.).In the next 20 years, algorithms will rule this planet. If you either want to see the future of your grandkids, or participate in it if you're young, this is a MUST HAVE exploration of where what we used to call AI is now headed. There IS plenty of calculus in this volume, so don't mistakenly think it is ""simple"" -- but if you put the time in, you can ""get it"" even if you're a bright undergrad level thinker. The author's goal of training new algorithm programmers is laudable and right on point for where pattern recognition is headed.With this amount of math, how can we star it high for self study? Easy: unlike most ""recipe"" books that just give bushels of codes or techniques, the authors here give the what, where when and why of both code and math, not just the how, as their goal is independent, creative contributors who can write their OWN algorithms. There are a few minor UK vs US differences in terminology also (event space instead of sample space, for example), but they expand the reader's horizon rather than distract or annoy as some others do. There are others like Bishop and many more that have more recipes, and more compact and difficult math, but you have to either be really good (just show me the recipe) or really bad (I don't know what I'm doing, but can follow this recipe) to benefit from them. This is a happy middle ground that does not disappoint.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning
"BRML is one of the best machine learning books I've read (others include Bishops PRML, Alpaydin's book, and Marsland's algorithmic ML book). In my view, it isn't the best one to start with and a combination of intro course lectures from Coursera or Udacity, basic tutorials online and some reading on Quora or StackExchange, and one of the books I mentioned before are probably best for the absolute beginner. Reason being, ML is ultimately a mathematical subject and this book isn't afraid to use it to explain things. That said, it isn't crazy advanced stuff, so if you're comfortable reading math then you will be OK.The book covers a very large amount of material, and at times it can be lacking in deeper explanations that may be more beneficial to the beginner. This is to be expected somewhat, but if you are looking for something more comprehensive in a particular area then you are more likely to be some type of professional and you should be skilled enough to know how to dig deeper (whether that is with other texts or papers online, and there are references to support this process in BRML at the ends of the chapters). It's not simple reading, but if you pay attention you should learn a lot.I haven't personally gone over the graphical models-related parts in detail, but I have gone through the introductory chapters and chapters on machine learning, neural networks, sampling methods, and a few others. This book delivered on the mathematical rigor just when I needed it most. If you are an ML algorithms researcher, this is a very good book to have around for reference. From the chapters that I have read, I was able to implement many machine learning algorithms from scratch. Eventually I'll get to the more complicated ones (I'm looking forward to attempting an HMM), but the simple ones so far have been easy after reading through Barber's explanations.The supplementary code available is OK, not the most organized and not too well-commented, but I'm absolutely thankful for its existence as it has helped to clarify things many times in ways that abstract mathematical symbols cannot. Being able to play with code that I didn't want to write myself is very helpful when I don't want to start from scratch myself. But I'm just nitpicking a little here, and most books don't come with code so really Barber is ahead of the curve on this one. There is also ample pseudocode, which is helpful when the code itself isn't too clear.Like some of the other reviewers I began reading this book from the PDF draft that David Barber has made available online, and that ultimately motivated me to buy a hard copy. I highly recommend this book, but if you have doubts just have a look for yourself!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning
"This book is a fair consolidation of most bayesian machine learning algorithms, and one can gradually build up the necessary knowledge going through this book (not necessarily in the order of the book as written, nor in a single pass). It is however best used in conjunction with additional resources on the subject, i.e. online resources that deal with specific concepts from different angles than the book. The last comment applies also to the math/probability refresher chapters.One aspect somewhat lacking is a more systematic treatment of computational complexity, given that this and similar books are read by practitioners who need to code, modify or analyze code implementations.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning

Also, it covers more material that Bishop. Chapters on dynamic models and graphical models are particularly awesome.

I bought the paperback and this print is bad. I would have been fine with it if the seller had described what I'm getting. It would have been up to me to consider the price-quality trade-off. But not mentioning that in the description is disingenuous. I'm not sure who is to blame - the seller or the publisher. The seller is definitely to blame for selling this copy on Amazon - see pics.Here's the problem: most of the book is printed in black and white. Even the pages that are supposed to have colored images on them. However, there are clumps of successive pages, with just the colored images from these pages inserted within the binding.  It's quite clear that all of the book was printed in black and white, and then the relatively expensive colored printing was done by grouping together images from across the chapters. Sometimes you'd see a colored image from a chapter that is appears after the image!Look at the attached pics.1st pic: chapter appears after image. The image is tagged as ""24.3"", but see the equation number that appears quite a few pages later: ""17.1.4"".2nd pic: Image 17.15 appears as in black and white in the chapter, but appears later again in the clump of the color-printed pages.3rd pic: some images do not have a colored version.

"If you want to understand the mathematics and techniques behind machine learning, and not just merely treat it as a black box or Python library, this is the book to have.  I wouldn't recommend it as the first book to read on machine learning; there are others that give a better overview (I recommend Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Geron for that).  But to dive into the math behind the techniques, there is no better place to start than A First Course in Machine Learning, followed by Introduction to Machine Learning by Ethem Alpaydin.I am not a machine learning expert (if I were I wouldn't be reading books about machine learning).  I am a professor of meteorology who wants to understand machine learning.  This book was written in a style and manner that resonated with me.  It is written in the way that I would have written it (if I knew enough about machine learning to write such a book).  The organization is logical, and the explanations and examples just make sense.  Perhaps I benefited from reading several other books prior, but when I read this book everything else I had read finally made sense.My only minor quibble, and this is just based on my own personal preference, is I wish the examples were in Python rather than MatLab, since Python is freely available and seems to be the primary platform for machine learning practitioners.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A First Course in Machine Learning (Chapman & Hall/CRC Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition)

"I am updating my review of this book because apparently in my first review I didn't do a very good job. This made the review less than useful.  I will try to do a better job this time.  If it still isn't helpful let me know and I will try again.Like the title says, this book takes an algorithmic approach to teaching machine learning - as opposed to an applied or example based approach.  The expectation is that you would get a tutorial on all the main algorithms rather than how to put various algorithms together to solve a particular problem in, say, fraud detection.The Contents reveal the algorithm basis:1. Introduction (types of machine learning, why you would want to do it in the first place and a quick introduction to supervised learning)2. Preliminaries (Key ideas about the problem of over fitting and the what I consider the most important topic: how to test and know when you have a program that has learned something other than the noise). Here the author also covers some ideas about the role of probability.  Calling it ""turning data into probabilities"" is a bit odd, but that's really what we do.  Early on he gets the key ideas of the ROC curve out of the way - something many texts just gloss over.I think the secret to understanding machine learning is understanding the idea behind the bias-variance trade-off (it is also handled very well in 
The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)
 which I used to teach a class and read before I read this book.3. Coverage of Artificial Neural Networks starting with the perceptron and why you would want to go beyond linear discriminators4. The multilayer ANN5. Radial Basis Functions and Splines - this is interesting because, Andrew Ng presents a linear regression as the most basic learning algorithm in his Coursera course which means all of the fitting methods, even when not used for classification are relevant.6. Is a section on dimensional reduction - feature selection and other methods like PCA and even factor analysis (most people stop with PCA which I personally think is a mistake, because you can accidentally end up keeping the features with all the noise and throwing out the meaningful linear combinations.7.This is a cool section not seen in basic books on probabilistic methods - sure everyone teaches k-NN, but this one has a nice discussion of Gaussian mixture models8. Talks about the support vector machine.  Most people don't get introduced to the idea that ANN and SVMs are actually very similar - they are both large margin classifiers and so knowing something about SVMs will help, even if you end up with some other large margin classifier (with or without kernels)9. This section talks about search and optimization.  The way Ng teaches machine learning, you always begin with the error surface, take the derivative and then search for a minimum in the learning function.  You quit teaching when you have minimized the error on the training set without out driving the error too high on the validation set - so in a way all these approaches are optimization methods.10. A whole section of genetic algorithms (which I jumped to first) a very clear explanation and a good example that really ran so I could see what was going on.11. Reinforcement learning12. Learning with trees - CART trees end the chapter something everyone working in this area should know something about.  He saves random forests for the next section (where I suppose it really belongs)13. This section is on bagging an boosting and then compares the idea of a collection of weak learners (like stubby random trees) as a powerful tool - the idea behind random forests.14. Unsupervised learning.  People tend to focus on supervised learning for a very good reason, but there are lots of examples where the cost of putting a label on a data example is too high, so an unsupervised method is a good call.15. Coverage of Markov Chain methods (MCMC) - again this does not get covered in every applied book.16. Graphical models - the Bayesian Network and Probabilistic Network Models along with the hidden Markov models17. Deep belief networks18. Gaussian process regression and classificationThe book concludes with an appendix on Python - getting started etc.  I don't think this is quite enough Phython unless you are already pretty familiar with the language.A critic of my first review  suggested that I just bashed R and didn't talk about the book - not a completely unfair statement.  R keeps data in data frames and Python is much more list and directory based.  Data frames and collections are related and there are ways to do list comprehension in both languages. and Python has a data frame package to make using R-like constructs easier if you happen to be coming from R and like them (the package is called Pandas)  Both are good languages, but I will stand by my original statement that R is a statistical language at its core.  Many of the packages are written in C so they are fast (like the ones written for Python). It has been my experience that the open source tools for R development are just what the commentator said: they are adequate.  I my humble opinion, R-Studio has a lot of catching up to do to be as good as professional tools like the JetBrains stuff (PyCharm).  Look at MatLab compared to Octave. At lest the community version of PyCharm is free.  R-Studio is not fast, and he dirty secret of R is that everything you do has to fit in memory at once, so you have to be very careful with memory management or you will run out and R will crash - it happens to me everyday.  Almost all of the ML methods are statistically based so R and all the books (like 
An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics)

Advanced R (Chapman & Hall/CRC The R Series)
.  This will give you a deep dive on the internals.  Compare it to 
Python Scripting for Computational Science (Texts in Computational Science and Engineering)
 and make the call for yourself.I have used both R and Python for both prototyping advanced algorithms and putting code live in production.  What tipped the scale for me was the productivity.  Now that the data science community has started building state-of-art tools for Python, (not to say anything negative about the statistics community who put all of machine learning on a solid footing), I prefer a rapid development language with good tools, test-first frameworks and solid software engineering practices as part of the culture.  The book reviewed here allows you to learn almost all of the algorithms used for machine learning and in the end you will be able to produce fast, readable, testable code.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/CRC Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition)
"I am somewhat disappointed by this book. Today I'm feeling generous, but it was tough to bump this up from 2-stars because to me it at times created more confusion than anything else.First off, this is an introduction certainly, probably at the sophomore college level. The math is there but not used especially well, and I believe the intention of the book is to sort of cater to those whose math backgrounds aren't very good. There is certainly a need for a book like this, but it shouldn't be used for more than supplementary material.There are many errors in this book, sometimes typographical but other times a little more serious. The writing style puts a bit of stress on the reader and I find myself jumping around the paragraph sometimes trying to figure out what is being said. The tone is meant to be casual and simple, but coupled with the numerous errors in the book it really felt like this edition was rushed. This was the most disappointing aspect.This book was useful to me for clarifying some things, but only because it was a different explanation that wasn't bogged down in mathematical rigor. I think it is a very good idea to have several books on the same subject for which you are studying seriously (I have three or four books on quantum mechanics, and even then it took many reads through them to really understand it). This book served its purpose in that sense. I also bought it because I was eagerly awaiting deep learning topics to find their way into ML texts. Sadly, this book didn't help me as I had been reading papers at this point, but I think it was a good introduction to deep learning and the types of neural networks typically used to build them and I applaud this initial effort by the author to include the material. I did find a few mistakes in the earlier chapters on Hopfield networks specifically, but I don't remember them being serious.I'm a Python programmer who uses Numpy a lot, and this was the best feature of this book. Most of the time I could quickly glance at the code and see what was really happening, and looking over the included code clarified some things for me as well. For textbooks in computational areas nowadays there's no excuse for not providing code, and I'm very glad to have had that to look at.Overall, this book could have been a lot better and has the potential to be a really great introduction to ML as its own textbook (at the underclass level, i.e. freshman and sophomore). The author simply didn't put in enough time to revising, or perhaps it was the editor's fault, not sure. The heavy usage of actual code was a big plus for me, and it covered some topics that aren't typically covered (deep neural networks) which was done well. For someone who is somewhat familiar with ML, this is a decent book to sprint through just to review and glean some bits and pieces. For the beginner, it can be a good introduction especially if you aren't as good at math as you'd like to be, but I'd recommend using it as a supplement to something at a higher level (perhaps Bishop's or Alpaydin's book, or even David Barber's book).",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman & Hall/CRC Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition)

"For those diving into machine learning who are rusty at math or not a math expert this is a solid, understandable book on the topic.  It covers a wide variety of machine learning algorithms, and while it does include some math, the math isn't the primary and only focus like other books on the topic.  The math sections are less involved, giving the formulas and basic information the various algorithms are based on, but most importantly it's accompanied by easier to understand explanations and pseudo code/actual code implementations.

"Pretty mediocre book, doesn’t go into very much detail in any of the chapters, tries to cover everything so does a generally weak job.  This might be suitable for a non-data practitioner who wants to have an idea of what tools their data practitioners use. But don’t expect to learn how to actually use any of these tools.As a textbook for a class I’m taking, the formatting is poor, with example boxes split across multiple pages unnecessarily, and text that is hard to understand. In particular, the chapter comparing R and Python begins with a comparison of both languages, masking them seem very similar in nature, when in reality they’re pretty different. And when I went to the second half of this chapter to learn about R, it was a superficial treatment that didn’t highlight the most important packages to learn, and then the IDE Coverage was of a tool that at the time of writing did not even support R.  No coverage of R studio, etc.If you know python and the pandas library, you will see that if you followed the example in the excerpt photo in this review, people would question your training.  You can do it this way, but there are pythonic conventions.  This is not how you typically import pandas or define a pandas dataframe.

"By page count, this is primarily a book on R, with some additional time spent on machine learning.There is way too much time spent on R, dedicated to such things as parsing email messages, and spidering webpages, etc. These are things that no-one with other tools available would do in R. And it's not that it's easier to do it in R, it's actually harder than using an appropriate library, like JavaMail. And yet, while much time is spent in details, like regexes to extract dates (ick!), more interesting R functions are given short shrift.There's some good material in here, but it's buried under the weight of doing everything in R. If you are a non-programmer, and want to use only one hammer for everything, then R is not a bad choice.

I do still hope the publisher eventually releases a true Kindle edition as these provide more flexibility in sizing fonts and light & dark mode support.

The iPad Kindle edition graphs are usable, but many equations are too small to see. The PC Kindle edition has very poor sizing of both equations and graphs - to the point that you need a screen magnifier to see any details. I purposely gave this book a 1-star rating in the hope that they'd update the Kindle editions to make the equations and graphs usable. I will revise the rating to 5-stars if they do.

This book runs with the suggestion that you already have a good understanding of python, both in terms of general use and data cleansing. Not only does it walk you threw some projects, but if you take time to break down the code and attempt to understand the “why am I using this” instead of “what do I have to replace for my own job” you will learn a lot more.Personally, I love these kind of books because it shows you multiple ways to test a model, recommends you run multiple models, and even use some underrated features of python.

"I will start off by saying on a scale of 1 to 10 in data science / machine learning knowledge (1 being ""I barely know what a linear model"" is and 10 being ""I contribute to building Machine Learning Libraries / conduct research"") that I am around a 4. I initially bought this book because I have a decent understanding of Data Science (created a few models at work and personally) and was interested in ways to serve the model via webserver like flask/django.The best analogy I can give about this book is its like going to a restaurant seeing ""beef stew"" on the menu and ordering it. When it arrives, you realize it is just beef broth and when you complain to the waiter they tell you ""beef was stewed in it, but you have to pay extra for the actual beef"". Hence the title of my review.Chapter after chapter I kept waiting for him to dive into the python scripts and explaining how they build the model. In this 250 page book, maybe 30 of the pages are dedicated to explaining the model and pipeline with the rest dedicated to superficially explaining DS/ML concepts.It doesn't go deep enough for anyone who has an intermediate level of knowledge DS/ML. On the other hand, it doesn't explain enough for people who might be beginners. For example, it just assumes you understand when to apply XGBoost versus using Scikit-Learn. But then on the next page it tries to explain the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Like you are expecting the reader to understand how different Machine Learning libraries affect computational needs, but then assume they don't know the most basic clustering algorithm? What???To me it feels more like a hastily written, half white paper/half wiki article about DS/ML algorithms, Computer Science, and how Machine Learning is actually bad for humanity.Also, he interviews people who have DS/ML experience, which is a good idea and cool in theory, but some of the interviews just feel like sales pitches for their products. Like, I haven't used StictchFix, and it might be a great product, but I will go to their website to learn about it. I don't want to pay to read a sales pitch.I wish I could return this book, but have already highlighted it from from to back. Please don't buy this book unless you fall into whatever very niche group this author targeted the book towards. Instead buy Hands on Machine Learning if you want to learn more about DS/ML. If you want to know how to deploy your models, maybe try Applied Data Science 2.0, but due to version updates and dependencies I couldn't get it to deploy, but the reference on how to build the pipeline is useful.To me this book felt like a lot of bad Medium or Towards Data Science articles stacked on top of each other.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going from Idea to Product

"In real world, three cohorts would approach Machine Learning differently -  A. Programmers - ""How"" - interested in quickly learning the libraries, tips/tricks to scale algorithms with larger data sets  B. Theorists - ""What"" - interested in choosing the right algorithm, design ensemble, selecting and extracting right features  C. Fashionists - ""Show"" - in this category, some of the even basic reporting/analytics are not termed ""Machine Learning"", need enough buzzwords pieced together to repaint the old apps.Flach's book is a great source for those who are 75%-25% between first two, and perhaps even greater especially if your Linear Algebra (basics) is not too rusty. It gives a wide and somewhat deep tour of the landscape broken into four paradigms (Quantitative/Analytical, Logical, Geometric, Probabilitisic) and does a real good job on feature design. The book is interspersed with some key insights that are not to be found elsewhere (e.g., how the 'pseudo-inverse' in OLS is really decorrelate-scale-normalize the distribution; Skew-Kurtosis are the statistical measure of ""shape""; Naive Bayes is not only Naive but also not particularly Bayesian; How Laplacian Estimate generalizes into Pseudo-Counts and then to m-estimate etc.). After ""deep reading"" of the book over a month or so, I also went through Flach's detailed 500+ slide presentation (check out his website) on this book. It was very useful to improve solutions several key machine learning problems at work. Flach especially shines on usage of ROC to algorithm comparison which has been his key research area.A few items that I think would've nailed 5-stars -1. Total omission of Neural Nets (ANNs)2. Only a glimpse of RBF while discussing the generalization from kNN to GMMs - as a key activation function more detailed treatment on RBF would help.3. Flach does a really good job of summarizing - at the end of each chapter and at the end of the book - the key insights. A similar ""Real World Insights"", which are interspersed in the book (e.g., how Naive Bayes is a GREAT classifier, but lousy estimator), aggregated would have helped.Overall, going back in time, I would buy and study it again. For a great first book, I recommend Hastie's ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning"", or Hal Duame's ""A Course In Machine Learning"" (ciml.info). After finishing this book, I would recommend ""Pattern Classification"" (Duda, Stork) which further elaborates on most stuff here and also has a great elucidation on Neural Networks.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning

The author is very thorough in their writing, making sure to fill in the details so you dont get left behind in the mathematical notation. The book is filled with beautiful graphs and other figures to further help the reader along in their understanding of machine learning.As a heads up, this book is heavy on the theory and light on the application, so keep that in mind when considering this book for purchase.

"I'm constantly on the lookout for new resources to share with my teams, which tend to be composed of folks from all kinds of backgrounds: formal CS, self-taught, code-camps, and other educational backgrounds (or even fields). Not everyone has the same level of math skills at the start, and some need refreshers from time to time.I had a chance to review Paul Orland's book and compare it to some other books on my shelf. This book doesn't try to be a rigorous first principles math book. It doesn't focus on trying to give you a deep dive on the math topics (e.g. looking at proofs and the like). It also isn't a book geared towards Computer Science specifically (no math topics on sets, logic, graph theory, complexity, combinatorics, etc).instead, it covers a selection of topics of interest to programmers/developers, delivered in three parts/areas: 1) 2/3D math (particular linear algebra techniques for doing various matrix calculations), but then applying to higher dimensions, 2) Basic Calculus techniques for simple physical simulation and Fourier analysis, and 3) a light intro into some useful techniques frequently found in Machine Learning applications.What I like is that is focuses on explaining enough of these math topics you can get the gist, and more importantly, how to think about these technique and translate to programming (in Python, here). After reading it, I took away an appreciation of how to apply some new (old) tools to practical problems at hand (e.g. fitting functions to data, basic classifiers, etc)For my team mates who have very little math background, they may need a little help, and online resources (like Khan Academy) are good supplements. This is not ""dumbed down"" content, it still takes some study. It is approachable though.For folks who remember their geometry, algebra, trig, and basic calc, but haven't really had to apply it to programming, this will be informative on how to think about certain kinds of problems and implement certain algorithms in the event that what they are looking for isn't immediately found in the language of choice's math or other libraries.Overall, a worthwhile read if you want to refresh on math as a developer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Math for Programmers: 3D graphics machine learning and simulations with Python
"I found this book to have really excellent coverage of a number of important topics in math. Often programmers, even ones with a lot of experience, have become a little distanced from the kinds of math which drives a lot of modern tech - computer graphics, optimization, machine learning etc. A decent appreciation for the math underpinning these can open a LOT of doors for those who've become a little stuck with more dull or mundane programming tasks, but the problem is how to acquire (or refresh) these skills. Math courses online can cover the ground eventually, but there are a lot of areas to know about and finding the right relevance or level of detail is hard. The author of this book really hit the mark for me, and the fact that every concept is illustrated in code makes the knowledge transfer significantly easier. Some of the stuff was definitely stuff I knew but had forgotten or hadn't used in a while (matrices, dot and cross products, calculus), other was familiar but I'd never applied it (Fourier series), and some was completely new. The book doesn't pretend to give an encyclopedic  coverage of math, neither does it make claims about depth for the concepts it does cover, but it DOES give more than enough to get you right into the subject with a minimum of effort and in a really engaging way.Regarding programming knowledge, I think you do need some to get the most of it, though it doesn't need to be in Python - the book is for programmers after all.I'd thoroughly recommend it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Math for Programmers: 3D graphics machine learning and simulations with Python

"I am using this text in a University (American) Data Mining Certification Program.  This book is horrible for learning -- truly dreadful attempt by an obviously disinterested professor.  It does not help that a worthless SW program is used in the course, Weka, which is hardly recognized within the industry.  And for good reason: Weka (termed for some New Zealand bird??) is clunky: the user-interface is poorly designed, the program accepts minimal hyperparameters, and the graphic output is so ugly that you'll wish for ggplot -- or find yourself dumping your output into Excel.  The author is a professor at a New Zealand university, and seems friendly enough, although very flighty at time (visit his Youtube channel for instructions on how to use Weka -- but don't expect a thorough review, and be prepared to skip the first 15 seconds of him playing his horn instrument - dreadful).  I found an alternative Youtube channel of a Data Science Professor in the US who provided far superior Weka instructions.The Book: it has such poor structure that you'll want to throw it against a wall and start over: I did.  The author, for whatever reason determined to break the book into complexity, vs structuring it by method/model (ideal structure might be: Supervised methods in Section I, Unsupervised methods in Section II).  Chapter 3 introduces many DM methods/models (which is appropriate enough), but thereafter he continues with the same structure in the remainder of the text: never creating a section exclusively dedicated to Decision Trees or Regression Models, for example.  The result is that it is very difficult to gain in-depth knowledge of any on particular method.  You'll find yourself going back several chapters to re-learn methods, vs building upon your method knowledge one method at a time.  Perhaps this is done intentionally as Witten seems to enjoy being cryptic and unhelpful in his Youtube videos. It is clear that he and his co-author have not solicited editing reviews from other 'good' authors.The Writing: Imagine a very intelligent Computer Scientist (but very poor - obviously tenured - instructor) recording his own random, unstructured thoughts about a complex topic; to be used by his own University Students.  Get it? Witten's aim in NOT to instruct, but to befuddle and confound his Masters students.  Unless you find yourself at the University of .... Waikado (I think is the name), and in his program, you should really not even go here.  He constantly utilizes the ""e.g."" reference where unnecessary.  In several critical places in the text, Witten will title a chapter or section with a DM concept (Clustering, for example) but then never provide a sufficient definition of the concept: it's bewildering!  His co-author can be found online (at CS information sites) providing equally cryptic - and often snotty - answers to peoples' legitimate inquiries about how to use Weka.

"This book is a great knowledge resource for those who are looking for fundamental concepts (not that exaustive) in Graph Theory and the applicability for the day-to-day challenges to tackle with Machine Learning.In a very pragmatic approach, the most known graph libraries in this industry are used for graph algorithms. The authors also invest some time to explain the fundamental math reasoning for each of the algorithms and its complexity in terms of efficiency.I got very impressed by the coverage of some libraries I never heard before like stellargraph and the GraphSAGE and also the support from classic libraries like numpy, pandas, Tensorflow/Keras and Scikit learn to perform data transformation and Machine Learning Pipelines over graph data.It is important to highlight the quality of the data visualization and the related toolings to support insights from a topological analysis over the results.It got my special attention in the chapter about NLP and Knowledge Graph, where the autor makes use of spaCy to build knowledge graph. I just missed more detail for the fundamental recipe to create a KG with respect to Ontologies. However it is easy to understand how to cover that need by following the instructions on creating your own corpora dataset.The book goes from graoh theory domain until level until software design solution when onboard the topic about distributed paradigm for algorithms and processing engines (spark vs giraph).

"Although I've been a machine learning practitioner for several years, graph machine learning was never something I knew much about until I read this textbook. Graph-based data structures are not as common as tabular or key:value pair (see NoSQL) structures, so there aren't a lot of resources available to cover the unique techniques needed to apply ML. As an introduction to the field, this book does a good job but if you have no background in ML or college-level mathematics (particularly linear algebra), it will probably be too much to ingest.Graph Machine Learning relies on the defacto ML programming standard, Python, to cover its coded examples and more specifically the package 'networkx' and 'node2vec' for graph embeddings. The examples are easy to follow but keep in mind that the ever-changing world of OS Python packages means that some of the examples could fail with future updates (obviously not something the authors or Packt can help without new editions).Chapter 9 of this textbook also covers building end-to-end applications that utilize graph ML. Here, I wish most could have been written on the topic since productionizing any ML model is typically the most challenging part. However, I'll let it slide as it probably would have increased the size of the book by quite a few chapters and this is, after all, what I'd see as an introductory book.Finally, and a typical issue I've had with Packt books in general, is that the book is printed in black-and-white which makes some of the visualizations hard to understand...especially if a reference in the text is made about some color in the graph. Granted, Packt does provide a link to a PDF with color images, but I wonder how hard it would be to just print the book in color to begin with. Color aside, there are a few instances in the book where the images of the graphs simply look like a jumble of nodes and edges where it is hard to discern anything meaningful.That said, this book will be my go-to reference for the foreseeable future.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Graph Machine Learning: Take graph data to the next level applying machine learning techniques and algorithms
"As Matt (the author) states in the intro to this book, it will not teach you ""from scratch"" data science or machine learning. While not suitable for one's first exposure to the material, it serves an excellent companion piece once you have some foundational data science/ML knowledge and a little bit of Python knowledge (pandas will help too).The book provides a thorough, example-driven treatment of every major step in a DS/ML project, from data cleaning to model evaluation. There's also coverage in terms of many common model scenarios (classification and regression) and the main models within each of those buckets (e.g., Logistic Regression for Classification and Linear/Random Forest for regression). While the book covers a lot of territory relatively speaking, the focus is on practical implications/takeaways versus going through a lot of academic background/boilerplate material. This approach gives the book a nice balance of levity and economy in its delivery.An aspect of the book that I appreciated is that it is very well segmented into terms of individual topics. Often points of interest have their own short section and are not buried in a forest of dense paragraphs. For example, if I wanted to look up something on how to deal with missing data or pre-processing steps, these have separate sections with example code provided.A pleasant surprise from this book was that it exposed me to a somewhat recent data science visualization library Yellowbrick. It's a very handy and easy-to-use library for visualization a lot of common data science charts (e.g., confusion matrix, residual versus predicted value). There are other examples of new data science visualization tools that the reader will be exposed to that I have not seen covered elsewhere (e.g., Shapley).Overall, this is a valuable companion piece either to go through end-to-end or to use as a reference when going through your own data science projects.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning Pocket Reference: Working with Structured Data in Python
"Machine Learning is a large domain and a book covering this topic needs to choose carefully what to cover. In Machine Learning Pocket Reference, the author chooses to focus on processing structured data. This means he avoids discussing neural network libraries such as TensorFlow or Natural Language Processing tools like spaCy or NLTK. This conscious decision means he can focus on clear and detailed code examples for solving traditional classification or regression problems using scikit-learn (and other python tools). Each chapter uses concise code samples to walk through how to use many different python packages to work through the multiple steps of a typical machine learning problem. This book is best for someone that has a little bit of exposure to python, pandas and scikit-learn and wishes to learn how to use these tools effectively. It also provides a very good introduction to about 36 other python libraries commonly used in the data science field.If you find yourself looking for quick reminders of how to use functions or are interested in multiple approaches to solving a python data science problem, this book will be a great addition to your bookshelf (real or virtual).One quick note about the size of the book.

The examples are given in the python notebook files, starting from simple solutions as detecting anomalies and to specific and more narrow examples of how to continuously retrain a model in the serverless cloud.This book will definitely be interesting for engineers who start deploying their models in production and want to make this process work the best way for their business.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning Engineering with Python: Manage the production life cycle of machine learning models using MLOps with practical examples
"The first chapter provided a really thorough breakdown surrounding the different data-oriented roles. It was clear to me the responsibilities of each of the roles. What was most helpful was navigating the table of contents, so that I was able to go to the necessary sections I was interested in studying. The examples of where we can apply ML and the System Design breakdown was most helpful for me to understand more of the systems engineering concepts. One thing I would recommend would be to have some Q&A for the reader to test their knowledge or understanding of the concepts and when/where to apply them. I would also be interested in hearing the author's perspective on how they think the world of ML will change, mainly the technologies being leveraged (I liked the AutoML example).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning Engineering with Python: Manage the production life cycle of machine learning models using MLOps with practical examples

"In this book the author has laid out the details of Serverless computing effortlessly. He has described every aspect of Serverless computing and what it takes for an application to become Serverless.In the first three chapters, the author has described Serverless architectures for a layman followed by in depth analysis of the Architectures of ""Yle"" (social media site), ""acloudguru""(website that teaches online students).In the last two chapters the author has described the pre-requisites and the detaiks for implementing a SQS,  and how to transcribe a video file (break it into smaller segments, separate the audio then merge the files in a binary tree format) to get the final video with the contents merged appropriately.The things I liked about this book1.

"AWS can be a whirling dervish of expanding services and new features for professionals and people just starting their careers. So let's break this down to a simple question.Why is this book worth your money and lifetime?The book provides accessible hands on updates to the labs/workshops from the first edition and has expanded architectural analysis of different implementations and lessons learned. If you are completely unfamiliar or lightly familiar with the subject matter, the labs/workshops will give you the hands on ability to both engage the material and consider directions and design choices made by others in a tone that does not come off as 'carved in stone'. But wait you say, I'm an experienced professional! What more do I have to learn? Go back to my opening statement, AWS is constantly changing and the book provides experienced views of implementations and lessons learned, sometimes we can avoid a mistake by learning about how others thoughtfully made it.What is the book missing?It would have been great to have additional detail or an appendix regarding metrics and key points of interest that were being tracked which led to architecture and implementation shifts in the use cases. What was done and how would the authors approach the same architecture/engineering issues today?Expanding cost analysis in appendix B, I understand that cost analysis is really dry material but a critical factor of success is understanding cost patterns and building muscle to recognize and remediate inefficiencies.I enjoyed this book so much, I even bought access to the 2ed edition when it was a work in progress at Manning. The updated labs/workshops helped to enforce the concepts and ideas, I still consider the material both educational and even entertaining. Peter's work was quite good in the first edition, inputs from Yan and Ajay seem to have made the second edition even better.I hope this review helps and with you the best of luck.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Serverless Architectures on AWS Second Edition
"One of the troubles with learning system architecture is that one is exposed to a limited number at work, and the architectures you can imagine and implement yourself. I loved reading through these architectures and getting exposed to ideas that I'm not already exposed to. Also, I generally love to have a hard-copy book so I can continue my learning when I'm away from my computer -- and I love getting away from my computer. I especially like trying to rate the architectures based on fitness criteria. Great practice. Thank you, authors.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Serverless Architectures on AWS Second Edition

"AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) is taking the data science and machine learning (ML) world from the realm of ""auto-magic"" reserved for the super-specialists in the field, and now bringing it more broadly to a wider spectrum of enterprise professionals involved with the A.I. and ML in their organizations. This is great. What's greater is that the major cloud platform providers have a wide selection of AutoML tools, services, and capabilities to support those diverse cross-enterprise functions. Now, the icing on this cake is this book by Dennis Sawyers. This book delivers a brilliant, in-depth, and comprehensive selection of specific business-ready cloud-based ML solutions that can be learned and applied by professionals who have basic foundational knowledge but not necessarily ""magician""-level expertise. (Remember Arthur C. Clarke's great quote: ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."") In following and developing the solutions presented here (including code samples, screenshots, and system access instructions), beginners (including students) and established ML pros (and anyone in between) can expand their knowledge of the algorithms, techniques, and applications of ML and A.I.The progression in the presentation of topics in the book is perfect for many audiences (including ML courses): introduction, getting started, loading and transforming data, Python notebooks, your first AutoML model, regression, classification, forecasting, ensembles of models, real-time batch scoring, pipelines, end-to-end implementation and orchestration of the built solutions, creating web-accessible endpoints, and (the real prize at the end) producing real business value from all of these data-intensive algorithms, tools, and methods. Anyone who learns and applies the solutions presented here may soon qualify as an AutoML magician, well more likely as an AutoML expert in their organization. The magic is waiting here for those who reach for it.(Note: I received a complimentary e-copy of the book from the publisher.)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Automated Machine Learning with Microsoft Azure: Build highly accurate and scalable end-to-end AI solutions with Azure AutoML
"5 stars. Fantastic text. I am an experienced technical professional who already had substantial experience in Azure Automated ML and I can honestly say that I have never had access to a resource as comprehensive to learning Auto ML as this book. I believe that 95% of what I have learned 'on the job' over the course of many months could have been learned from this book in ~2-3 weeks. The text is concise and includes step-by-step guidance to develop an end-to-end Machine Learning solution using Auto ML -- from data ingestion, to model development, to scoring and deployment.In my opinion, Automated Machine Learning with Microsoft Azure, covers four topic areas (and does so extremely well). 1. Introduction to Automated ML and the Azure Machine Learning Service ecosystem -- Chapters 1,2  a. Begin with learning the terminologies, technologies, and real-world drivers that are the basis for creating ML models.  b. Walkthrough of the AML workspace/GUI  c. Great place to start for those reading from a 'novice' level. 2. Building ML models w/ Automated ML -- Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  a. Covers the three different problem types for Auto ML (Regression, Classification, Forecasting)  b. Fantastic sense of 'leveling up' from chapter to chapter -- from basic w/ the wizard to MMSA code only. 3. Leveraging ancillary technologies for other important data science activities -- Chapters 9, 10, 11  a. Data science doesn't happen in a vacuum! These chapters are indispensable to doing real data science. Data ingestion, model deployment, and containerized code all are necessities to actually get any business value form your machine learning work.  b. These chapters should get special attention in order to really leverage you investment in data science! 4. Applying data science to business -- Chapters 1, 8, 12  a. To quote this book, ""Realizing business value ultimately comes down to whether your business partners choose to act on the predictions of your ML models."" There is a special emphasis on WHY and HOW machine learning helps us realize business value which elevates this book from a 'just' a technical manual to an incredibly insightful guide on how machine learning (through the lens of Automated Machine Learning on Azure) can create real value for business.These four topics amount to an awesome journey from learning what automated machine learning is, to real advice and instruction to leverage this technology to power business. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in using data science to increase business efficiency or anyone who wishes to learn the optimal way to perform machine learning activities in the Azure cloud. Well worth the read.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Automated Machine Learning with Microsoft Azure: Build highly accurate and scalable end-to-end AI solutions with Azure AutoML
"The author does not try to mislead the reader; in fact, the author makes it clear from the beginning that the majority of data science projects never make it into production. The author makes a point that this wouldn't be quite so bad should data scientists fail quickly, learn from their mistakes, and then begin anew; but, the author points out that is not what typically happens. This provides a great introduction to the topic. It doesn't paint a rosy picture of data science, but it builds the reader's interest. One thought I had after reading the introduction was: ""Well, I should avoid those pitfalls and, instead, learn how to fail quickly."" The author then jumps immediately into the basics of Machine Learning.It should be noted at this time, that the book does expect some background knowledge; otherwise, the reader may get caught in the weeds - trying to look up or understand every definition that may be glossed over. The intent of this book was not for someone with no subject-matter knowledge, and the other makes this clear.Soon after the introduction, in chapter 2, this book provides a step-by-step guide in order to help the user begin a Machine Learning project on Microsoft Azure by going over the technical requirements and explaining how the programs work in Microsoft Azure. The author is very thorough, but he is also easy to follow. If you want to get the most out of the material, I would recommend establishing a project whilst reading the chapter; that way, you may have the chance to process the information at a deeper level by seeing it in practice.This book does a great job of explaining the big picture by breaking it down into small pieces. The first chapter introduces you to a potential problem of Data Scientists and then proceeds to teach you how to avoid those pitfalls. The second chapter helps to get you set up and ready to work on Microsoft Azure. The third chapter helps teach you how to build an ML model on Microsoft Azure. The fourth chapter then begins to look at specific tools that one can use.This book helps you to understand the topics covered in a very efficient manner every step of the way. As you understand more, the author starts to trust your knowledge by assuming a baseline of knowledge for the next chapter. I find this a fantastic way to write a book as time is not wasted explaining the same topics repeatedly.I could not recommend this book more highly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Automated Machine Learning with Microsoft Azure: Build highly accurate and scalable end-to-end AI solutions with Azure AutoML
"I'm a few chapters into the book, and I have to say that I really like the writing style. The author has a knack for clear, and to-the-point, explanations along with good analogies/examples to drive home the ideas. He does a great job of laying bare industry-wide problems, explaining how an estimated 87% of AI models 'fail slow', over a drawn out period of time, and thus, expensively. He explains how they are cumbersome to build while difficult for end users to trust. The author explains how AutoML can help data science teams to 'fail fast', and much less expensively! He explains how it can help companies discover, much sooner, when a model is no longer worth pursuing while deploying the model with a few clicks when it's worthwhile. Fast failure and less cumbersome successes seem to be the key to delivering a return on investment.I'm looking forward to diving more into the book, but it should be known that the author warns, ""You need to have beginner-level knowledge of artificial intelligence and a technical background in computer science, statistics, or information technology"" to be able to follow along comfortably. I'd agree, as the definitions of some terms are assumed by the author while certain concepts are introduced, or referenced, without prior exploration.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Automated Machine Learning with Microsoft Azure: Build highly accurate and scalable end-to-end AI solutions with Azure AutoML

"I was really excited when I found this book on Amazon. It seemed like the perfect source to get up to speed with some of Microsoft's new Azure machine learning tools - especially since I am starting a new role at work where I'll be using a lot of these tools.I was ready to give up after the first chapter. It felt like most of it was excerpts from Wikipedia. Also, a lot of the content was wrong! For example, when you have outliers in a dataset, the common practice is to reject them, not ""impute alternate values."" Where are these ""alternate values"" coming from if the outlier was obviously outside the expected range? Reading the first chapter felt like reading a term paper about ML written by a college sophomore.I did try to press on, though. I thought, well, the author is more of an expert on applying Microsoft tools than the theory of ML so I'll give the part of the book that is the reason I bought the book in the first place a chance. Sadly, it was no better. It felt like a cobbled together collection of marketing speak about Azure. A lot of times, the sentences didn't even make sense. Plus, the author would talk about an API and then say, this API was deprecated by Microsoft so let's talk about what replaced it. Why talk about the deprecated API at all? It just makes the book confusing.I finally had to admit to myself that, even though I dropped nearly $50 on this book, wasting my time trying to read it was an even greater waste of money.Bottom line: Don't bother with this book.

"I have the first edition and MEAP copy of 2nd edition.  This is the strangest 2nd edition I’ve ever seen, since the 1st edition’s authors are gone from the 2nd edition.  About 65% seems to be a repeat of 1st edition.  Charts, images, diagrams, and large blocks of text are used unedited from 1st edition. This includes code blocks that were written in TF1 in 1st ed.There are new sections within each original chapters and several new whole chapters.  Seems to have 150 more pages.  I am just starting to read the 2nd edition, but style differences will be a factor.  The first edition had an excessively friendly tone, which may not be maintained by the new author.  I liked the friendly tone of 1st edition author, Nishant Shukla (with Kenneth Fricklas).  Also the differences between TF 2 and TF 1 is not a small matter.  TF1 requires pre-compile setup of a “session”, while TF2 generally does not. And most people use Keras as the interface to setup their models in TF2.  Could still be an interesting book.  I don’t know yet.  Github has code notebooks in TF2 for most of the chapters, so will help with running example code from the book.  I may update after I read more.  TF2 is used more in production with multiple GPUs and TPUs, so a chapter on efficient parallelism would have been useful in the 2nd ed.  Anyway, buyer beware.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with TensorFlow Second Edition
"Chris Mattmann's tone and style make getting your feet wet with the potentially tricky concept of machine learning an easy dip into a warm and welcoming pool. First off, yes, TensorFlow 2 is out but the concepts behind machine learning haven't changed, and indeed much of the TensorFlow API remains stable. I wouldn't let that deter you from diving into this book. Linear regression, Markov models, and convolutional neural networks are still the core concepts, and Mattmann takes you gently through them.Now that sounds like math, and yes, there's no shortage of it. But Mattmann makes the matrix handling and distance computations easy. But best of all, there's code: we jump into firing up a Jupyter Notebook and entering Python, comparing our results with the book's. The exercises reinforce what we're learning and also spark exploration and imagination for projects either for our jobs or personal lives. (Yes, I'm literally inspired to develop a sequence-to-sequence model related to a home project after reading this!)What's especially lovely about this book is the code annotation. Rather than just present code fragments that awkwardly refer to them from the main body text, Mattmann uses copious displays, arrows, and explanations of the code; see the image attached to this review for an example. This makes learning Tensor Flow a breeze!Overall I'm really happy with this book. I purchased it directly through the publisher which means online access and updates are ""built-in"". Perhaps that'll include better Tensor Flow 2 coverage!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with TensorFlow Second Edition
"This book is not really about Tensorflow per se. It does use Tensorflow to illustrate ideas, but it doesn't actually spend much time explaining the ins and out of Tensorflow other than the early chapter on computation graphs and sessions. For example, it mentions the Dataset API and then shows it in code, but doesn't explain it any further. it is written for TF1 despite TF2 being released before the book was published. The timing is unfortunate.The editing is also questionable. There are technical errors, of course, like any technical book would have. But there are also mystifying editorial decisions. For example, the charts were originally produced in color, and the text even refers to the charts by colors. But the book itself is printed in black and white. So when the text refers to ""the red line and blue line"" in the chart, you're actually seeing two gray lines. The book must really be intended to read as a PDF, not a printed book.Finally, there's the pacing of the book. I associate Tensorflow with deep learning and would have liked some more exposition about how those models work. But the first 55% of the book is based on non-ANN models, and then the deep learning gets crammed into the last 45%. It's super ambitious to try to cover as many topics as he does, but ultimately the book would be better with fewer, longer chapters.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with TensorFlow Second Edition
"I usually don't leave reviews, but I wanted to address a previous reviewer who left one star because the book was not written using TensorFlow 2. While it is true that TensorFlow 2 is not used directly in the text, the author has included a complete translation from TF1 to TF2 in the git repository, so honestly it's not an issue at all.What is important is the underlying concepts and techniques. Linear regression, SVMs, stochastic gradient descent, and all of the material taught in the book will remain relevant and foundational to the science of machine learning for years to come. Indeed, the TF1 vs TF2 thing is really a non-issue, since TF2 still makes use of TF1 primitives and the idea of graph-based networks has not changed.It is more valuable to me to have an authoritative source like Dr. Mattmann teaching me the material then it is to focus in on some specific version of a language or framework. It's not hard for even a basic programmer to switch between Python2 and Python3, or between TF1 and TF2 for that matter. You'd be hard-pressed to use the argument ""but it was written in an older version"" when your boss asks you to update some legacy code!My advice to future readers: read the book as intended, but keep the TF2 branch open on github while you do so. Look for the subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) differences between TF1 and TF2 as you read. It's also worth noting that everything is available as a (rather large) set of docker containers.

"This is short and mostly readable account of some of the main ideas in machine learning, including brief coverage of neural nets.  It's well-organized and there are lots of useful examples and diagrams.Take the subtitle of this book (""an applied mathematics introduction"") seriously.  The author says in the prologue that the book is targeted to a narrow audience of applied mathematicians.The author jumps back and forth between very high-level discussion and hand-wavy technical discussion that assumes background in at least multivariable calculus and linear algebra.  Does this work well for applied mathematicians?  I think it will disappoint ML beginners without enough math background, and those with some ML experience who are looking for something concise and rigorous.One example is the brief PCA discussion, which assumes you will instantly see that what is needed is to get the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.  Another is the discussion of lasso regression, which suggests that the reader should make a plot and ""draw comparisons between minimizing the loss function with penalty term and minimizing the loss function with a constant"".  (The book Intro to Statistical Learning with R actually explains this connection.)In some parts of the book I like the balance between intuition and technical detail.  For example, I like the discussion of bias and variance (but have never found those target pictures very helpful).Some rigorous and concise books on machine learning that I like include  Tom Mitchell's class Machine Learning and Hal Daumé III's A Course in Machine Learning.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning: An Applied Mathematics Introduction

"Due to not taking the book's title at face value, I didn't realize what I was getting into.  I misappropriated the ""introduction"" term and as such, it left me disappointed with the book.  This is not the book's fault however.This is the type of book that's useful if you have a strong foundation in math.  There's it's subtitle is ""...An Applied Mathematics Introduction.""It is such that if you do have strong math skills, then this book will be of great importance to you as you understand how to apply math towards machine learning.If you are like me and learning machine learning on your own and don't quite have the mathematical foundation then it will be a high hurdle to overcome as you read.The book is broken down into chapters which cover various machine learning methodologies.  They give a quick synopsis of what the methodology is and when you would use.  Then the math begins.It is by no means heavy on math, but it is rich in math.  I do enjoy Wilmott's writing style but for me, I need a more basic introduction towards math and due to my own misreading of the title, thought this would aid me.For a pop culture analogy:  there's a Simpsons episode where Homer is reading a book on advanced marketing.

Coming from a non mathematical backround the explanation of each algorithm and idea presented in the book was very easy to grasp (although I got lost when trying to follow the more advanced equations). This book has really improved my understanding on the topic and I am giving it a second read to fully understand all the math.

Great resource. It’s like talking to someone one who is just giving you the simple straight answer to what’s going on. This book’s tone and depth is between the buzz word laden “intro to machine learning” books for business people and the “too much math for non majors” textbooks that focus a specific type of machine learning.With that said I use it to gain an intuition and the first layers of mathematical depth to each ML algorithm.

"I think this book is worth reading if you already have a background in Machine Learning. Otherwise, a few things will be frustrating. But, I still recommend the book; just be sure you are the right audience.Let me start with the cons and then the pros.The first negative aspect of the book is that mathematical theories are not deeply covered. For example at page 18, there is the MSE which fails to explain (IMO) the ""E"". Similarly at page 22 when the concept of ""regularization"" is explained, we can argue that the whole section could be ""keep it simple with the linear function"" and the reader would get the same information instead of these many paragraphs. Another example that the writer miss is the set in context. Page 28 explains the One-Hot encoding but fails to justify that it improves runtime execution analysis by having boolean value. Instead, it mentions the ""sparse matrix"" that is well handled by ""scipy"" which is the first mention without much content around it. I can provide many other examples like the scaling that come into the picture way too early to see that it is worth it. No examples are provided (page 29).On the bright side, the book uses popular Python libraries. For example, it uses the Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. But reading page 37, you can see that the user assume some level of expertise by assuming that we are aware of what Anaconda or Miniconda is by leaving the any explanation why the latter is preferable for casual user.Chapter two starts with a project of building a recommendation engine with the Naive Bayes. That time the author is doing a great job explaining the training data set and the prediction stage.  The binary explanation is fine. However, building the recommendation engine seems to take aside with a smaller example using the MNIST with recognizing numbers and cancer examples. I found that part confusing why the main announced topic path was derailing. The Bayes theorem brings mathematical notations, which is fine, and the author ensures an example with numbers is provided to support the theory.Page 56 is where Python code starts. The quality of the representation of the code is, for me, average. The background is dark, and the type is white, which contrasts a lot. It seems that it has been copy-pasted since you can even see the ""..."" at each line. Not that is wrong, but some polishing could be applied. The code is commented, which is a plus. However, the code has a cons of the lack of space, making snippets extend to many pages.On page 75, the course is at recognizing a face. That is quite a feat if you never performed machine learning. But, it is motivating to exercise with an image. For some reason, I recalled from a past lecture (years ago) that SVM was not an efficient way to classify information. I do not see in this book any detail about SVM's advantages and disadvantages, which is disappointing. The chapter discusses the plane and multiplanes at the level that you are comfortable.Chapter 4 talks about a topic (IMO) that is simpler than the previous one with SVM. None the say that the subject of information gain and entropy can be confusing, but the author's writing is well suited. The only problem are the wall of code.Page 227 introduces information about linear regression, which is similar to the logistic regression previously taught. The link between them simplifies the understanding of this theory.To conclude,  the book is well built. I am someone who prefer more example of a single topic, and it is not the case in the book. You get a single explanation and a single sample. Code can be hard to follow sometimes because of the length, but that is a natural disadvantage of the medium. I recommend the book for people who already have/had a background and want to refresh their skills. I am afraid that it will be too much information without the depth required to fully understand for a newcomer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Machine Learning Example: Build intelligent systems using Python TensorFlow 2 PyTorch and scikit-learn 3rd Edition
"This book is very large, and it's almost like 2 books in one -- a more classic applied ML in Python book combined with a deep learning in Python book.  I have not read the entire thing, since it is very long (500 pages). The writing is good in general. I assume reading the entire book and going through all examples could take 40 hours or more (that could be a massive underestimate, I have no idea). The deep learning sections are roughly 100 pages long. I like how Yuxi has implementations of some of the algos in scratch, then shows how to use them with the canonical sklearn library. I also like chapter 11 on ML best practices, though I think it is probably missing some things and could contain more information in general.I appreciate the equations and math for some of the algos in there; however, it will be hard to understand some of it without calculus background (e.g. he uses the chain rule while taking a derivative without explaining it). But, you can always post the equation on a stack overflow site or quora and get help.The end of each chapter usually has a few exercises, which are intended to help you practice what you learned. They are good, but I wish some of these were a little more substantial. Sometimes they are sometimes simply ""do the same thing we just did, but more"", and are usually there are only a few exercises.What it's lacking:- ethical concerns of ML and what to do about it; this includes algo bias, data privacy, and model drift- guidelines for when to use what model (although maybe I missed this as I haven't read the whole thing)- pros/cons of each model, and computation complexities of the models- the H2O library (good for dumping in raw data without cleaning, can handle NaNs and categorical columns)- other clustering algos besides kmeans (like DBSCAN)- semi-supervised learningThat being said, it's still a huge book with tons of valuable information.I also am not a fan of the syntax highlighting and code sample style, although it allows you to see inputs and outputs at the same time. They basically copied code from a .py file into IPython, so the ... and >>> prompts are on the left side of almost every line (which is distracting to me, especially if it's a bigger function). The syntax highlighting color scheme is ugly in my opinion, with functions highlighted as bright green, keywords in pink, and comments as a dark color on a dark background. I included a few screenshots so you can decide for yourself if you're ok with it. While this works great for one-liners with output, IMO it's not a good idea for functions and bigger code chunks.As is expected with a book this large, some errors are present.

"Python ML By Example (BE) is a good complement to Python ML Third Edition (3E). The 3E book focuses on the theory and general application of ML programming, while the BE book focuses an specific application examples.While they both tackle ML programming, their approach is different. The BE book assumes you have a reasonable, foundational background in ML and uses that basis to create specific ML-based applications.For example, whereas 3E has a simple note about Naïve Bayes classification, the BE book has a whole chapter dedicated to the algorithm, discussing the different types of classification methods, how Naïve Bayes works, and then actually implementing a Naïve Bayes application. On the flip side, the 3E book has a whole chapter dedicated just to the different classifiers and different implementations of them using scikit-learn.It's almost like the 3E book is a textbook and the BE book is its complementary workbook for practice. While you may be able to be successful with either one, combining them really maximizes your ML learning.To speak about the BE book in more detail, the topics covered include:*Introduction to Python ML, including software installation*Using Naïve Bayes algorithm to create movie recommendation application*Using SVM for facial recognition*Using tree-based algorithms to predict ad click-through*Using Apache Spark to work with large data sets*Using regression algorithms and neural networks to predict the stock market*Using text analysis and NLP to data mine newsgroups*Using unsupervised learning models to identify newsgroups topics*Using different types of neural networks for different types of analysis approaches*Using reinforcement learning for decision making*ML best practicesIt is a long book (nearly 500 pages), but the material is invaluable for anyone in the ML field, especially if you don't have a lot of experience with the different algorithms.

"The book is a great practical resource for those interested in applying ML techniques quickly. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is a bit light on theory and the more technical aspects of ML until you get deeper into the book. Having said that, the examples and code provided are very practical and to the point. I would recommend it if you are either already familiar with basic ML theory and the math behind it or if you have a software engineering background and are simply looking to quickly implement an ML solution. The author walks you through code segments and explains each step and by the end, you will have covered most of the more popular ML models and know which ones to use given your data and your goals.The chapters on SVMs and building and predicting ad-clicks are very practical. I like how the author walks through each model type and compares them so you have a baseline and can see the differences in implementation and result. That was a helpful exercise spread across a few chapters. Also, the Best Practices chapter near the end was a good, ""I need an answer quickly"" kind of reference.Overall, I liked the book and think it would be helpful from a more practical perspective.

My favorite chapters were the ones on Facial Recognition and predicting financial market pattern, as those are the most relevant to my own work.  The Best Practices section in Ch. 11 will save you from a lot of issues.  I think this book would be approachable to beginners, as the author starts from a foundation level and goes up from there.

"I have been using The Elements of Statistical Learning for years, so it is finally time to try and review it.The Elements of Statistical Learning is a comprehensive mathematical treatment of machine learning from a statistical perspective.  This means you get good derivations of popular methods such as support vector machines, random forests, and graphical models; but each is developed only after the appropriate (and wrongly considered less sexy) statistical framework has already been derived (linear models, kernel smoothing, ensembles, and so on).In addition to having excellent and correct mathematical derivations of important algorithms The Elements of Statistical Learning is fairly unique in that it actually uses the math to accomplish big things.  My favorite examples come from Chapter 3 ""Linear Methods for Regression.""  The standard treatments of these methods depend heavily on respectful memorization of regurgitation of original iterative procedure definitions of the various regression methods.  In such a standard formulation two regression methods are different if they have superficially different steps or if different citation/priority histories.  The Elements of Statistical Learning instead derives the stopping conditions of each method and considers methods the same if they generate the same solution (regardless of how they claim they do it) and compares consequences and results of different methods.  This hard use of isomorphism allows amazing results such as Figure 3.15 (which shows how Least Angle Regression differs from Lasso regression, not just in algorithm description or history: but by picking different models from the same data) and section 3.5.2 (which can separate Partial Least Squares' design CLAIM of fixing the x-dominance found in principle components analysis from how effective it actually is as fixing such problems).The biggest issue is who is the book for?  This is a mathy book emphasizing deep understanding over mere implementation.  Unlike some lesser machine learning books the math is not there for appearances or mere intimidating typesetting: it is there to allow the authors to organize many methods into a smaller number of consistent themes. So I would say the book is for researchers and machine algorithm developers.  If you have a specific issue that is making inference difficult you may find the solution in this book.  This is good for researchers but probably off-putting for tinkers (as this book likely has methods superior to their current favorite new idea).  The interested student will also benefit from this book, the derivations are done well so you learn a lot by working through them.Finally- don't buy the kindle version, but the print book.  This book is satisfying deep reading and you will want the advantages of the printed page (and Amazon's issues in conversion are certainly not the authors' fault).",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining Inference and Prediction Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)
"I like this book but with some reservations.For an intermediate or advanced student, this is a great book for expanding your toolkit -- it discusses and explores many techniques with which you are probably already familiar, and plenty more with which you are probably not. This book has a smorgasbord of in-depth explorations of a wide array of useful techniques. So it's great as a reference, and a great read for any practitioner looking to add more tools to their toolbox (and aren't we all looking for that)?As noted, though, I have a few reservations. First, I wouldn't recommend this for the beginner -- many of the derivations skip some steps that are obvious if you've seen this problem before, but not so much if you're seeing it for the first time, and the importance and area of application of each technique isn't always made clear. This is a good book to read, but it shouldn't be your first.Second, some of the material is a little...dated. The material on neural networks is so dated it's basically not useful -- doesn't discuss any of the more recent advances (dropout, batch normalization, LSTMs etc), and same goes for any material in here related to image recognition. (Nearest neighbors with handcrafted features for image recognition? seriously? What about CNNs?) Of course that's probably just a function of when this was written.Keeping those reservations in mind, though, this book will give you a thorough grounding in a wide array of powerful techniques for analyzing your data.

"This review is written from the perspective of a programmer who has sometimes had the chance to choose, hire, and work with algorithms and the mathematician/statisticians that love them in order to get things done for startup companies.  I don't know if this review will be as helpful to professional mathematicians, statisticians, or computer scientists.The good news is, this is pretty much the most important book you are going to read in the space.  It will tie everything together for you in a way that I haven't seen any other book attempt.  The bad news is you're going to have to work for it.  If you just need to use a tool for a single task this book won't be worth it; think of it as a way to train yourself in the fundamentals of the space, but don't expect a recipe book.  Get something in the ""using R"" series for that.When it came out in 2001 my sense of machine learning was of a jumbled set of recipes that tended to work in some cases.  This book showed me how the statistical concepts of bias, variance, smoothing and complexity cut across both fields of traditional statistics and inference and the machine learning algorithms made possible by cheaper cpus. Chapters 2-5 are worth the price of the book by themselves for their overview of learning, linear methods, and how those methods can be adopted for non-linear basis functions.The hard parts:First, don't bother reading this book if you aren't willing to learn at least the basics of linear algebra first.  Skim the second and third chapters to get a sense for how rustyyour linear algebra is and then come back when you're ready.Second, you really really want to use the SQRRR technique with this book.  Having that glimpse of where you are going really helps guide you're understanding when you dig in for real.Third, I wish I had known of R when I first read this; I recommend using it along with some sample data sets to follow along with the text so the concepts become skills not justabstract relationships to forget.  It would probably be worth the extra time, and I wish I had known to do that then.Fourth, if you are reading this on your own time while making a living, don't expect to finish the book in a month or two.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining Inference and Prediction Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)
"I have finished reading the book, but I feel somewhat confused...Although I think I did pretty good with math in graduate school (Physics PhD from a good school), I find it hard to follow some of the derivations. The book specified the prerequisite level of one elementary course of statistics and some linear algebra. But I feel the actual requirement for math is much higher, especially in the multivariate statistics and matrix representations. I often find myself staring at the formulas and trying to get the big picture.This book is particularly good in terms of grabbing the insights and intuitions underneath the different methods. It covers a vast majority of different techniques, and trying to present the ideas and intuitions why this method works or how this method is an implementation of a simpler idea, e.g.various obvious or hidden implementations of lasso regularization. This is impressive. No one can do better because the authors are actually leading researchers who either invented these ideas or made significant contributions to their development.Unfortunately, this book is not a textbook for outsiders of machine learning research. The actual implementations/algorithm are not covered in detail, provided often as-is, and have weak links to the presented formulas. The indices or notations in the formulas are sometimes not mentioned, and some of the key concepts for understanding the principles are not introduced. I presume researchers in this field would usually have a common sense of what they are, but for someone like me, it is sometimes very difficult to follow.Anyway, it is great to finish this book. I don't know how much I could get from this book, but at least I have some feelings of how deep and how broad this field is, and know where to look if later I encounter problems. I would recommend an outside learner to step away from this book as a principle textbook and only use it as a reference. On the other hand, the book introduction to statistical learning by the same authors are highly recommended for new comers.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining Inference and Prediction Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)
"ESL is certainly a challenging read in the sense that you need to be comfortable with the topics of linear algebra, statistical theory, and the basics of probability theory. I would highly recommend supplementing this text with ""A Solution Manual and Notes for: The Elements of Statistical Learning by Jerome Friedman, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani"" (Weatherwax and Epstein) as they do a nice job supplying derivations and explanations to several of the equations presented in-text.There are certain regions of this book that are more mathematically intensive than others. Overall, I would say this book provides a solid overview of many of the important fundamental topics of statistical inference and machine learning. Deep neural networks are only given a single and rather light chapter so this book is not the best resource in that regard.The organization and presentation of the material is very pleasing and logical. I read the book cover-to-cover, but the authors provide some guidance on their recommendation for what parts of the book should be read first before skipping around.I would highly recommend this book if you are involved in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, but be prepared to wrestle with the material in order to understand it fully.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining Inference and Prediction Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)
"While expansive and overall just good, this is not great, and should not be the go-to book for people interested in learning machine learning. There's lots of ""it's easy to show..."" and lots of formulas just plopped down. For people interested in actually learning where stuff comes from in a complete and satisfying way, this is not a good book. This would be fine if this book was fantastic on the applied front, but it's absolutely not. This is a good book for people who want the basic idea and some good pointers/details along the way, but aren't looking for hardcore theory nor in the weeds applications.

"Math books, at least data science texts, can usually be divided into those which are easy to read but contain little technical rigor and those which are written with a scientific approach to methodology but are so equation dense that it’s hard to imagine them being read outside an advanced academic setting.Fortunately, The Elements of Statistical Learning proves the exception.  The text is full with the equations necessary to root the methodology without engaging the reader with long proofs that would tax those of us employing these techniques in the business world.The visual aspects of the text seem to have been written with John Tukey or Edward Tufte in mind.  Though their frequent use makes the book some seven hundred pages long, reading and comprehension is made much easier.And, though it’s been almost ten years since the book was published, the techniques described remain, for the most part, at the cutting edge of data science.I was told by some other analysts I know that this was their bible for data science.  I was somewhat skeptical of this kind of hyperbole but was pleasantly surprised that the book matched these high expectations.  If you have an undergraduate degree in a mathematically related discipline, The Elements of Statistical Learning will prove to be an invaluable reference to understand the rapidly advancing avalanche of data mining techniques.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining Inference and Prediction Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)
"This is a book for excelling undergraduate mathematicians or graduate-level mathematicians. Truthfully I'm not confident that I would have been able to truly grasp a lot of the material as an undergraduate Statistics major (maybe in my senior year).With that being said. If you're a mathematician then this book will give you a phenomenal grasp of the material in a time when everyone is getting into machine learning but no one actually knows any of the math. Is it important to know the math? Maybe not. You can become a successful analyst with only the computational experience. But I have a passion for the field and I enjoy knowing what it is I'm doing.Anyways, I especially recommend this book because it covers unsupervised learning. This is one of the most overlooked facets of machine learning and it's becoming an ever-growing field. I believe some of the next big statistical discoveries will be in unsupervised learning.Anyways, if you're not strong in mathematics then I recommend Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. That'll get you started in the field quite well! Good luck to all students and passionate observers!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining Inference and Prediction Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)
"This is a quite interesting, and extremely useful book, but it is wearing to read in large chunks.  The problem, if you want to call it that, is that it is essentially a 700 page catalogue of clever hacks in statistical learning.  From a technical point of view it is well-ehough structured, but there is not the slightest trace of an overarching philosophy.  And if you don't actually have a philosophical perspective in place before you start, the read you face might well be an even harder grind.  Be warned.Some of the reviews here complain that there is too much math.  I don't think that is an issue.  If you have decent intuitions in geometry, linear algebra, probability and information theory, then you should be able to cruise through and/or browse in a fairly relaxed way. If you don't have those intuitions, then you are attempting to read the wrong book.There were a couple of things that I expected (things I happen to know a bit about), but that were missing.  On the unsupervised learning side, the discussion of Gaussian mixture clustering was, I thought, a bit short and superficial, and did not bring out the combination of theoretical and practical power that the method offers.  On the supervised learning side, I was surprised that a book that dedicates so much time to linear regression finds no room for a discussion of Gaussian process regression as far as I could see (the nearest point of approach is the use of Gaussian radial basis functions [oops: having written that, I immediately came across a brief discussion (S5.8.1) of, essentially, GP regression - though with no reference to standard literature]).",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining Inference and Prediction Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)
"""The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference and Prediction,""  2nd edition by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman is the classic reference for the recent developments in machine learning statistical methods that have been developed at Stanford and other leading edge universities. Their book covers a broad range of topics and is filled with applications. Much new material has been added since the first edition was published in 2001. Since most of these procedures have been implemented in the open-source program R, this book provides a basic and needed reference for their application. Important estimation procedures discussed include MARS, GAM, Projection Pursuit, Exploratory Projection Pursuit, Random Forest, General Linear Models, Ridge Models and Lasso Models etc. There is an discussion of bagging and boosting and how these techniques can be used. There is an extensive index and the many of the datasets discussed are available from the web page of the book or from other sources on the web.  Each chapter has a number of problems that test mastery of the material. I have used material from this book in a number of graduate classes at the University of Illinois in Chicago and have implemented a number of the techniques in my software system B34S. While the 1969 book by Box and Jenkins set the stage for time series analysis using ARIMA and Transfer Function Models, Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman have produced the classic reference for a wide range of new and important techniques in the area of Machine Learning.

I run a business with a text-analysis product and have a team of data scientists working on this problem. This book is without doubt my favourite on how to use text to answer real-world questions.The difference between this and most other books is that the authors come from a problem-based perspective and describe how to use the various text analysis techniques to help solve the problem. Almost everyone else comes from a technical perspective. As such it's probably going to age better than most - I could imagine swapping out older technical solutions for newer ones but the approach is likely to be resilient.After working full-time in this domain for the last 7 or 8 years at times I felt I was learning something new every other page.

"I read this immediately after Python Crash Course. I experimented with Python about 20 years ago and now I'm back with it (and far more serious about it). There are a lot of interesting little nuances to be aware of, especially as you continue to develop larger, more in-depth code. That's what this book is. You'll get to see some of the back-end of how Python interprets code so you can avoid certain errors that would probably drive you absolutely nuts in debugging (enough of that will happen with your programming experience, you don't want to add to it).The other benefit of this book is to learn how to write ""clean"", ""pythonic"" code. There are general conventions that professional software developers use that you will want to use from the beginning so you don't develop bad habits. If you've already done development, some of it may be a repeat for you and you'll simply skim past. If you're new to professional software development, you'll find this extremely helpful.Keep in mind that the book does run through numerous applications of Python. It's a versatile language. You may have very specific needs and certain parts of the book may not pertain to you. Also, if you're just writing short scripts, this may not necessarily be for you (although you may want to pick up good habits if you think you might expand your use of Python later).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python: Best Practices for Writing Clean Code

It also includes a valuable survey of commonly misused syntax, gotchas, efficiency, and some ""esoteric oddities"", Python tricks and lessons I have not seen in any other books.No Starch Press reliably puts out great books.

"This is IMO the best advanced book on Python.  I read the first edition five years ago or so - 900 pages - and am now working the through the second edition - 1500 pages.  This book is not for the casual Python programmer, however.  I have been writing Python code for more than twenty years, but I learn new things or sharpen my knowledge with every chapter.  The coverage is comprehensive; the writing is very clear, and the example code is carefully annotated.I had been eagerly awaiting this new edition, which is a year or two late from the original publication date, but I am very disappointed with the Kindle version, which was fine in the first edition.  While the Kindle app on my pc works fine, it does not work on my iPad, which has plenty of free memory.  After just ten pages or so, the app freezes, and I cannot get any further.  I cannot even jump to later points in the book.The publisher, O'Reilly, refuses to take any responsibility for this.

"First of all, as to the content of the book: This is THE best book on Python in my opinion. It's the way to understand how Python works so that you can dance with it, not just sit on the sidelines wondering why things are the way they are. Get it, read it, and you WILL know Python at a much more substantive level than most Python programmers who have not read this.Many people (including the author) may warn you that this is an ""advanced book"" or that it focuses on the obscure topic of metaprogramming with __dunder__() methods in Python, but it turns out that the way it explains Python using these things ends up teaching you just exactly what you need to know to use the language effectively. It's (probably) not a book for a beginning programmer who needs humor and cartoons to keep them awake, but for anyone with a technical orientation who wants to just be told how things work, this is the best book you could ask for. It does not tell you anything you do not need to know.My advice for intelligent, motivated, technical people (like you I suspect) who want to learn Python is to first go through the official Python Tutorial (on the official Python website) if you need an introduction to the features of the language and then read this book from cover to cover.It's just a great book.Now a note on the production of this edition by O'Rielly: I was disappointed that they didn't do a nicer job with the production and printing of the 2nd edition. It's printed in monochrome on heavy paper which makes the physical book a serious tome at around 1,000 pages. For the price they're asking I was hoping to see something like the quality of their ""Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems 2nd Edition"" which is printed on thinner, higher-quality paper, in full color, and the paper flows and feels great in your hand and even though it's a big book it's really nice to own in that form. For Fluent Python, I recommend reading it in one of the electronic formats like Kindle or O'Reilly Learning, or I believe there's a source for an official purchasable PDF version that the author Tweeted about a while back. I have not seen the Kindle version myself, but I was very happy with the O'Reilly Learning online version and I presume the Kindle experience should be similar.In any case, it gets all the stars, and you should own a copy in some medium.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fluent Python: Clear Concise and Effective Programming
"Of course, we programmers know that everything we could want to know is out there, in fragmentary form, on the web. But I have a tediously fastidious mind that likes to keep the distinction clear between what I know and what I have yet to find out. As such, books are my preferred approach to a systematic learning process. I would have been very grateful then if someone had told me at the start of my Python journey that what and all I needed to read was the Tutorial at python.org, David Beasley's epically concise Python Distilled, and this, the 'lizard book'. This book demands a close, paragraph by paragraph reading and maybe some re-reading of some sections till full or at least deeper understanding dawns. After this book there isn't really anywhere to go except the source code and the dry and voluminous language docs. Whatever isn't actually in the book is there on the accompanying fpy.li website.A first point is that this is not a book for the beginner. One needs to have a reasonable grasp of the language having worked a while with it, being able to muddle along, but also knowing one is just muddling along and wishing to get things onto a more solid foundation.As such, I'm anxious not to let prospective readers be put off by the review that asserts that the author does not get to the point. There is no flab in this book. It is a big book, but a serious programmer could only wish that the book was even bigger and even more detailed. Python is as much an ideology about how to do things properly as a programming language. It is deceptively easy to muddle along in Python on the basis of what one has already come to know in more 'primitive' programming languages. But for the programmer determined to get the best from a language that has a near endless toolbox of subtle features and constructs the learning curve goes far deeper and longer than a superficial comprehension can suspect. Perhaps that reviewer is thinking about the soapbox sections at the end of each chapter in which the author considers the merits or not of particular decisions made in the complex, democratic language design process? If so, it should be pointed out that even here the author is inviting the reader to think more deeply and clearly about why such features were implemented as they were and what the alternatives might be.I have two complaints, notwithstanding which I still regard the book as indispensable and insubstitutable. Firstly, I wish very much there was a hardcover edition because the kind of reading this book demands means that the paperback cover is not going to survive even as much as a first reading. I would also like to see, perhaps in a future edition, a more comprehensive and systematic index. Again and again, one encounters situations where we know we have read something about this in 'the lizard book' but finding the requisite nugget or gem is not always that easy. The book does not work particularly well as a reference.A final point is that the book is a great pleasure to read without any loss of clarity. Although the author's knowledge is clearly formidable, he invites the reader to accompany him on a journey as a fellow traveller, pointing out the many small discoveries he has made in his own passage. One quickly comes to feel assured that even where one's own understanding might falter, everything you need to achieve understanding is written down there if one just reads it carefully enough. Few technical authors pass this test. The man is a natural teacher who always places himself in the point of view of the student and proceeds from there.A huge, rigorous, fractally detailed but profoundly enjoyable journey of a book. As simple as possible but no simpler. The mighty and beautiful 'lizard book'",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fluent Python: Clear Concise and Effective Programming
"Yes, this book is a very heavy reading. Not the content, the content is great. But whoever came across the idea to make a 1000-pages paperback edition of this excellent book should have considered to split it up to a three piece edition. That makes it really difficult to read this book in a relaxed position (I tried bed, bathtube and toilet, no way).Another drop of bitterness is that because the heavyness of this book the packaging of Amazon is too weak. And so I got this book with a big fat dog-ear on the front cover.However, the content itself is great, as I already mentioned. There is lot of information I may have known, but forgot it, or really new things I may to consider in the future.

"I have started getting back into coding once again with Python and prior to that Java.  Until now the books i got were good but not great and failed to hold my interest.  I find this Python basics book to be so well written and interesting.  I just hit chapter 7 and unlike some reviews I have read I have seen nothing that was not covered in prior chapters.  Yes an Index would have been nice but anything i need to go back and refresh is readily available on Google.  For me so far it is mostly going back to look at syntax.  The review exercises and challenges get a bit more complex with each chapter which is great.  Finally what I really like is that their examples often intentionally produce errors and odd behaviors and then they give very good explanations as to why it is that way and what to watch out for.

"While still reading the book and performing the exercises is good practice, I feel that the book is a good example of a practical introduction. Python 3 is a great programming language to learn, and the book has a fairly sufficient foundation for learning the language. Prior experience with Python 3 is not necessary, but understanding how a programming language works is a good primer to learn Python 3 and the book is structured like a timely exercise and practice format. Each topic is followed by a series of practical exercises, and doing these exercises helps with the knowledge gained. Some aspects of the language are covered that may be glossed over in a general explanation, but the book is patient with these aspects.Overall, I recommend this book for someone who wants to learn Python 3 in a few months (about two months on a continuous basis; otherwise, three to four months average for the whole book).",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3

[Make that a hand gesture of ""Eh, so-so.]I used this book to come up to speed on Python from a dead stop. I have a good deal of experience with other languages (C/C++, Fortran, a bit of Perl, C shell, bash, IDL, maybe one or two others that I have dipped into and since forgotten.) I can't say whether the book is good or not for total programming beginners; it's been too long since I was in that state.For people like me:What's good: you can read through it fairly quickly and get an overview of the concepts, syntax, etc., associated with Python. The assumption here is that you are someone who prefers to get an overview from kicking back with a book rather than becoming glazed, leaning over your laptop even longer than you already are, jumping around between web pages.What's bad: (1) There is no index! (??!??) This is a very grave defect and is the biggest reason that I deducted stars [and that after having the book for a few weeks, I deducted another star]. It seriously limits the usefulness of the book after you have flipped through it. Since one does not get all the concepts clearly just from a quick read, one would wish to refer to it for memory refreshment when trying to get traction. The lack of an index frustrates that and is really a drag; you have to search for what you are looking for, based on the table of contents, recollection and page-flipping. It's tiresome. I wonder if it is a result of rushing to market, or just plain laziness. [This issue has been such a problem and a pain that I am going to look for another book that can serve as a beginner's reference.] (2) Having also watched several excellent Python tutorials from India on YouTube, I can say that this book reads like a screenplay for YouTube tutorials. I couldn't count the number of times the book says, ""Let's dive in!"" ""Let's get started!"" Etc.! Etc.! Etc.! (i.e., way too many exclamation points in general) [; very lazy and somewhat condescending writing.] This became annoying. A minor point, certainly; no stars were deducted for this.  [I would add that the book is mostly white space with relatively large print. The amount of information is not commensurate with the number of pages.] (3) Very heavy promotion of the RealPython web site. No stars deducted for this, either. Just irritating.Evidently RealPython got out first with a book on Python3, or at least got out with some linear combination of being early plus having effective SEO. [Either that, or I was lazy and in a hurry when shopping for a book.] If and when the O'Reilly ""Learning Python"" book (author: Mark Lutz) comes out for Python3, I will buy that. I find the O'Reilly books hold their value as practical references even as you learn whatever skill it is better and better and even as new versions of the particular technology come out - up to a point. This book that I am reviewing won't do that. (BTW, I actually own ""Learning Python"" for Python 2.3, copyright 2004. But it is too old to be reliable even for basics on Python3. For example, the print() syntax has changed. If *that* doesn't work, then you know a book is out of date!) [This was not meant to be a plug for O'Reilly, just a comparison to books - typical O'Reilly books, for example, but by no means only O'Reilly -  that are heftier in terms of information content and hold their value.]The bottom line: depending on who you are and what your purpose is, this book could be very helpful. [Somewhat helpful.] But be aware of its limitations as you type in your credit card number. [At this point I would recommend looking for something else. Yeah, this can be useful, especially if your employer is buying it, not you, but if it is your money, look for something better. The lack of an index is really a disaster.]",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3

"I use this textbook for teaching computer programming to college students who are NOT contemplating majors or minors in Computer Science. It is a gentle approach to programming for students who intend to make a career in some other field. Contrary to the author's claim on the cover, it is NOT an introduction to the field of Computer Science. There is much, much more to the science of computing that simply learning a programming language.That being said, this is an excellent textbook for someone who has to program a computer in support of a career in another field -- for example, mathematics, the physical and biological sciences, the social sciences, business, the arts, etc.The author takes the student on a gentle journey thru the basic skills of instructing a computer using the Python language, itself a gentle language that avoids the arcana and seemingly obtuseness of most other computer languages. Few, if any, of my students have the time or patience for the rigor of other aspects of CS, but they come away with an appreciation that computers are no more magical than any other tool.By the end of my seven-week course, students will have calculated and graphed a cosine function from first principles. They will have counted the words in ""Moby Dick"" and will have listed them alphabetically, with their frequencies of occurrence. They will have drawn a game of Pong, showing balls bouncing around a Pong board, and they will have plotted real estate data on a regional map, based on latitude, longitude, and price.Most importantly, they will have enough if an appreciation for computer programming that they will not be ""snowed"" or intimidated by programmers when they enter their own professional careers. For someone in a similar situation, I highly recommend this book and the Python language that it teaches.A professor with a Ph. D. in Computer Science at a well-known technological university.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science 3rd Ed.
"I have both the physical book and the ebook. When they converted this book to ebook format, nobody checked the result against the original. The ebook has numbers show up randomly. These are page numbers in the original. They should be part of either a header or a footer, and never appear in the main text.The book is organized into numbered sections and subsections. Unfortunately, they used graphics instead of text in the original. The optical converter doesn't know quite how to handle them, so the section numbers are incorrect. It interprets some numbers as letters, and when the numbers are in a box, it translates the sides of the box as numeric '1'. Instead of section 2.3.2 inside a small box, it prints 12.3.21. My text to speech program then tells me the date ""December 3, 2021"". This is rather frustrating.Another concern is the typeface. Most books on computer languages switch to a fixed-width font when giving examples of code. The ebook does not do this, but has a uniform typeface which is variable-width. In my opinion, the physical book was put into an OCR program because it makes errors such as confusing number '1' and letter 'l' and number '0' with letter 'o'.Illustrations were also mangled during the conversion. The diagrams showing things like input to CPU to output (Figure 1.1) is unintelligible.I have experience in setting up technical manuals, so I know a lot about how a book is generated. This one needs a team to fix the formatting problems by comparing the physical book to the ebook. The ebook has mistakes on nearly every page.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science 3rd Ed.
"It's a typical textbook; more-artistic students can probably expect the content to be difficult to understand due to lack of readability.

"I am new to programming, and this book was very easy to understand and learn from. A few things (ex classes and objects) were a bit difficult to understand, so I just looked those up on YouTube. But in general, everything is extremely well explained and in simple English (not formal and scientific as in other textbooks).Also, the problems at the end of the chapter are extremely useful. The concept questions (T/F and multiple choice) help you understand. Their is a lot of programming practice problems.However, their are no answers to the problems (which IMO is a bad thing). But you can find answers online.After this book, you should check out Computer Science by Sedgewick, or Algorithms (also by Sedgewick), for further learning.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science 3rd Ed.

Excellent read. The author keeps concepts as simple as possible and fluid in delivery. I read the book for fun after already knowing python.

"Like all books by Steven F. Lott, this book is no exception. I read all books by Steven, and I always learn something from them. Besides teaching how to write OOP and use it, this book explains how to write OOP code using modern data types like NamedTuple, TypedDict, tuples, etc.As always, I learned excellent tips and techniques on how to write nice tests. There are also very interesting chapters on Concurrency and Design Patterns.My only complaint is the type of examples provided in this book. Examples are complicated, and they are based on machine learning data, sailing data, etc. So to understand an example, sometimes you need to understand the domain knowledge of the example. I wish examples were simpler to get a concept and then maybe provide more complex examples.Steven is not biased to OOP in this book, but he also explains the difference between OOP and functional programming and teaches where OOP would be the best fit.In any way, it's an excellent book, and I learned a lot from it, and I use it as a reference if I need to find an answer to my questions.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Object-Oriented Programming: Build robust and maintainable object-oriented Python applications and libraries 4th Edition
"Firstly, I must say that authors of this book definitely have a deep understanding of python and OOP. You will probably get more than you asked for I'm this book.This book definitely isn't for beginners and I would say it is targeted more towards the advanced python programmer. There is a lot of terminology in there I had to look up.Overall the book is ok. You will definitely learn some useful practices, but, the content is very dry. It would take a high level of concentration to not only go through each line I'd the book, but, also the exercises and sample code.I prefer a more simplistic book at my level, but, if you are very advanced with our hon and decent with OOP, I would recommend reading this book.

"This edition complicates the issues and takes away from the lessons learned.1. The examples in this edition are abstract and hard to follow compared to previous versions and distract from the actual learning experience which should solidify knowledge in the case studies, But instead confuse points.2. This edition also uses non-standard python syntax on definitions functions etc, which also complicates the learning experience, detracts from the points trying to be made and is absolutely not necessary in any way. This is not C or C++ where this type of syntax is needed or common place.I feel that you are better off with previous versions of this book if your goal is to learn the intended advertised material and not be bogged down by distractions and overcomplications of simple matters.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Python Object-Oriented Programming: Build robust and maintainable object-oriented Python applications and libraries 4th Edition

"I liked this book a lot I felt I was able to learn many things that I was expecting to learn from reading the table of contents. I recommend to everyone that they do the same before purchasing the book (or any book for that matter) so they can evaluate whether reading the book will be in their interests.With that I must say there are some things in the book that can weaken one's learning process. For one some of the examples that the author chooses are kind of complicated. And so, what may be gained regarding practicality (probably won't be so practical if you're not interested in the particular field) is lost with regard to complexity. I would just take a simple convoluted example any day. But I think this is a minor concern because a more advanced reader would know they don't have to understand every detail in a book before getting value out of it. This same issue applied to the case study which had to do with a machine learning algorithm. I think it was unnecessary to use such a case study because it's easy for a noob reader to get caught up in the details. However, I didn't get too caught up in the details and pretty much only focused on the software development aspects.Lastly, I think some things weren't explained very well such as the operator overloading section and also, I noticed some things were done that aren't really best practices. Such as inheriting directly from built-in collections (e.g. Dict) rather than using collections  (e.g. UserDict). I ironically learned this from another python book 😅 (Clean Code in Python) and I think the authors of this book could have easily mentioned this.All in all I still liked the book and you can see from my long review and I would possibly recommend it to others although it would depend on their python level and whether or not I thought they were a strong reader in order to overcome some of the aforementioned problems.Also I bought this book directly from packt when they had a $5 sale.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Object-Oriented Programming: Build robust and maintainable object-oriented Python applications and libraries 4th Edition
"Python-experienced or not, I recommend the book to you because it increases one’s knowledge of each topic  when contrasted and compared to another language perspective. If you work with object-oriented patterns in any medium, then this book will interest you.There are 750 pages of niceties. I dislike treasure-hunting a line-of-interest from each code example in some books. This book sets emphasized parts of code examples in boldface. In addition, each snippet is color-coded Python for readability. Python is duck-typed, but the authors statically type-checked the book’s accompanying code type flows with the mypy tool. So ... the included code works.The content is organized into four major sections:1. Well-known OOPs principles as reflected in Python — with good practices, case studies, and exercises in each chapter2. Built-in Python features from the OOPs viewpoint — these form a base for a contrast-and-compare with other languages3. Popular OOPS Design patterns4. Testing and concurrencyI liked Chapter 5 – When to use Object-Oriented Programming. It presents balanced coverage of a trade-off between an object-oriented rendition of an example and a more data-oriented version or a functional version.  It addresses Python’s lack of private members. The coverage delved into reasonable alternatives within typical OOPS design decisions.Chapter 8 — The Intersection of Object Oriented and Functional Programming, caught my eye. Functional programming has become cool after lurking in an academic setting while OOPS enjoyed two decades of limelight. The authors made a credible case for melding the two paths. They point out that Python functions are objects as well.Chapter 11 — Common Design Patterns, and Chapter 12 — Advanced Design Patterns, give 12 well-known design patterns their Python spins. The discussion about the singleton pattern was interesting. Python has no private constructor capability. Instead, a Python module is a singleton, so there’s the singleton container.Testing is well-covered in chapter 14 (pun intended).Concurrency is difficult. Chapter 14 covers usual concurrency topics. It was the most interesting chapter to me.  It enhanced my general understanding of these topics by letting me contrast and compare Python-based approaches to those I knew in other languages and libraries. You don’t need to know much Python to benefit from this chapter. It's a readable language. The Python GIL may be unique, however. The text doesn’t explicitly state that the interpreter runs in a single CPU core, where threads must time-share that core, as gated by the GIL.  The text says that the multiprocessing interface supports multiple concurrent core processes. Concurrency diagrams would have been helpful (especially the floorplan of Constantine and Mo’s diner).I say “get this book.” The authors have vast experience. I relate to the ancient one of the pair who has been programming forever. He lives on a boat that he relocates.  I wrote my first program in machine language on a vacuum tube computer in 1961. Yes, but I live in a simple non-moving house.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Object-Oriented Programming: Build robust and maintainable object-oriented Python applications and libraries 4th Edition
"If you, like me, have just recently started programming in Python and are still learning the language in detail, you would find this to be one of the best books available for covering the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in a simple yet detailed manner. The authors have done a fantastic job explaining the Object-Oriented Approach by teaching how to structure programs in Python.The book has 14 chapters that teach the design patterns used in Python, how to statically type-check your dynamic code, when to use Object-Oriented Features (and when not to use them), and other topics. In teaching good design, the authors teach OOP key concepts such as Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation.You get the latest Python Syntax as the book examples test with Python 3.9.5. I realized some of the codes in the 3rd Edition were not running well because of typing errors. But that’s what makes Programming fun and why we have the issues page in Github, right?  Yes, you get all the codes in the book on the provided Github link, which, in my opinion, makes it easier for reference.In every chapter, you get the background of the subject concept, detailed examples, best practices, common mistakes to avoid, a section to recall the chapter, structured exercises to test what you have learned, and, finally, a chapter summary. The case studies section gives the reader a detailed perspective of real-world scenarios and how to navigate them. You also get illustrated summaries and examples in the form of tables and figures throughout the book.++++++++++++++++++++Who this book is for?I would highly recommend this book to anyone in or starting out in Data Science and, specifically, from a non-Computer Science, background as the book clearly explains concepts that are new to non-traditional Computer Science students. The book considers the role of Python in Data Science and, hence, integrates Math and Statistics in examples of how to apply OOP concepts. Regardless of your path or field, these are skills that once you get right, everything else feels less uphill in your learning.++++++++++++I will give this book a 5/5 review.

"I liked that it seemed tailored to my needs where I'm at in my programming journey. I had previously read Python for Everybody and done most of the exercises there. The author of that book, Dr. Chuck, recommends this as a sequel to his book, for object-oriented practice, I believe, in the preface of P4E. Which is exactly what I'm getting out of it! What I noticed is that this book could be a good book for beginners, if you're not new to programming. There's nothing you cannot do. It's a dense dialectic, and seems like it was intended to be read, not skimmed. I haven't finished, so I don't know what a proper summary conclusion would be- as far as that didactic goes. Definitely has some insight, but I might have to study/take notes to remember.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist

"This is a fine book for someone who wants an introduction to Python programming. I think it is good for someone who is uncertain about what Python is all about.

However, if you want a survey of Python - what it can do, how it works (generally) - this is a good book.I like the easy-to-understand language used in this book.  The author does not make any assumptions about prior programming knowledge.The book just scratches the surface of Python. It runs though a large number of topics, touching each with just enough to give the reader an understanding of the bigger picture. However, it doesn't do a deep dive on any topic in particular.Overall, as a primer it's a great book.

"One of the best books I've read on programming so far. It's well written, easy to understand, very affordable, and there are some extra resources available to you as well, which I found really useful.The only caveat I would give is that this may not be the best choice for the math-averse, as many of the exercises involve dealing with math problems. I would not consider myself particularly mathematically inclined and can still get through them with some effort, and enjoy the challenge of learning something new and putting some long-unused brain cells to work, but it may be frustrating if you really hate math. There is always the option to skip exercises you don't like, of course.I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in programming, or wanting to learn Python, beginners included. I had a little programming experience coming in, and breezed through the first few chapters, but the exercises quickly build in difficulty so even after a few chapters, I think all but quite experienced programmers will find some that are challenging and help you build proficiency in the language.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist

"When this book arrived, I turned to the chapter entitled ""Files"" and saw  that reading text files had already been introduced and this chapter would discuss writing text files and databases for the purpose of storing data created by a program so that it can pick up later where it left off.This sounds like a sadly limited description of the capabilities of such a flexible and powerful language.  Or does Python really live in its own little world?I'm an old geezer in a hurry, looking for a computer language that will read existing binary files whose unicode names are provided from the Windows command line.  It doesn't sound like much to ask, but every computer language I know has one or another problem doing it.

"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.Fairly satisfied with this book and happy with/grateful for the foundation that’s it’s helped me lay so far!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python 3rd Edition

"This is a super handy in-depth guide to using Django. For context, I already had some experience in Python and I recently finished a full-stack course where we built several functioning Django servers. But after finishing the first chapter of this book I'd already learned so much more about how Django actually works! They really go in depth for each step and explain what's going on in the background, so it filled in a lot of blanks for me.The author organized chapters by project, so if you already have some experience with Django it's easy to jump straight into one that applies to you. (Building a blog, a social web site, an online shop, etc). But if you don't have any experience with Django I think it'd be a great exercise to follow each chapter's examples from start to finish and come away with a very solid understanding of the framework as a whole.

"This is an excellent book for both folks new to Django, as well as experienced Django devs.For engineers who are newer to Django, this book provides a clear and comprehensive introduction to the Django infrastructure as well as some of the tools that we often use alongside Django like Postgres, Docker, Redis, and Nginx.The example projects are well selected for explaining Django's tooling, and the descriptions are written in a way that is clear and approachable.For experienced Django devs, it serves as an up-to-date reference and good way to get current on newer Django features like async, ASGI, and Channels.I wish the section on QuerySets went into a bit more detail, particularly around the double-underscore syntax for querying across models, and filtering for things other than exact match (e.g. __in, __gte, etc.)  Those are shown in the examples, but I think they could be introduced more directly, as they are one of the things that really makes QuerySets powerful.I would also like to see the chapter on Django Rest Framework expanded in future editions, given how common it is these days to use Django as an API provider alongside JS-based frontend frameworks like React, Vue, etc.  I would have liked to see a bit more treatment of things like SerializerMethodFields, and some more of the philosophy of how an where to make customizations in DRF. However, the links in the ""Additional resources"" section do provide more detail on these topics and I understand the challenge of keeping the book size manageable.Overall, this is one of the most complete and well-written books on Django, and is up-to-date with current Django tooling and recent improvements to the framework.

"Before buying this book I heard about LPTHW and the ""controversy"" around...but obviously this is the internet and everyone is entitled say whatever they want so I didnt took them seriously.Before reading this book, I've read some C++ concepts in the past (couples of years before) but they were simple as: types, functions, statements.. so nothing complicated, but I went thru this book with a tiny bit of knowledge..At the beginning of the book I was amazed at how much fun I has having and how much better I was starting to understand those concepts (that I was already familiar with).The way the book is structured its extremely good: making your hands dirty immediately it's really the right thing to do for a beginner.It may be obvious for some one but wasn't for me, the fact that you should type everything you see and make it work on your own, and then read and check what is happening. Then type again and again and eventually, even if you don't REALLY understand the DEEPER MEANING of everything, you are still a step further to getting closer.So everything was going fine and I was eager to go to the next lesson...Till chapter 43 when he introduces the Class/Object..I honestly went back on it a couple of times but every time I felt that there was something different... somethings has changed from before... there was no more fun, no more understanding.. but just: DO IT AS I DO AND SHUT UP.There was little room for exploration as he presented a semi-empty script with empty classes  that you should fill as he would... oh and yea he just introduced you to what a class is like.. so good luck with that.You pass from ITS A, HAS A type of explanation to complete an already started script of several different classes with subclasses and inherits.. wtf? I've felt like I jumped 2 chapters...It was challenging? absolutely but it wasn't fun... it wasn't discovering new things... it was desperation of trying to solve this exercises because you know that classes are an important topic...And from there, it just got worst...At chapter 47 you are introduced to an another fundamental topic: TESTS.So as usual you start typing and typing and installing modules, you will get excited of all of this new stuff you will learn about... but you will be WRONG... because as soon as you finish he says:GO ON INTERNET AND FIND OUT HOW TO USE AND INSTALL EVERYTHING YOU JUST DID.....W.T.F... it took me a day to find out in the nose manual that their syntax was the same as unittest but just spelled with the format snake_case...As a beginner, and as I have never seen what an test/assert_equal is, I WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED A BIT OF EXPLANATION before sending me online..I had to go online and search for OTHER people tutorial about something that I was suppose to learn in this book... WTF AGAIN...And from here honestly I just lost interest... he doesn't show anymore the ""what you should"" see section so you are left on your own... If you don't understand: too bad... If you do understand but misunderstand also too bad... For me was harder trying to understand what HE will have me to do rather than the code itself...At the end of the book you will do automatic tests of his text game and deploy it online so he introduces some HTML concepts but honestly I just didn't care anymore and never finished.. and here brings me the major flaw about zed in my opinion.He states at the beginning that he doesn't want you to teach everything, but he wants you to be autonomous and be able to understand what to search bla bla... Ok! its a good mentality! But there is a problem.. programming concepts are so deep and so many (even for a subject alone).. that you NEED at least something information to start and only then LEAVE THE REST TO YOU if you want more info...Again: if I have to leave the beginner's book to search other tutorials for beginners to understand what has written in my beginner's book... I think that the book failed to do part of his job...I then IMMEDIATELY went to PYTHON CRASH COURSE and things just pop out like flowers in spring... and it was because of how zed open my view of how to take a programming book..So I recommend this book even despite the BIG disappointment of the last chapters, because I truly think that this book teaches you the discipline that you will absolutely need to start every other book.. but be aware you will not become a expert programmer after just this book... buy this together with PYTHON CRASH COURSE and think of them as one lesson.. typing (LPTHW) and understanding (PCC)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaws Hard Way Series)

"I consider myself somewhat intelligent. I have done some prior coding. I wanted to enhance my skills by putting coding on my resume. So that should tell you a bit about who i am and what I am seeking. I bought the book knowing that the title says ""the hard way "" in it.. Reading some of the book and looking at reviews I thought this is something I can handle.I think the book is excellent up to a certain point and then goes off the deep end. What I mean by this is that it starts out at a basic level teaching the reader how to install python and also how to write simple functions and such. great stuff and I like the approach. Then.. all of a sudden it jumps into OOP and starts talking about things I cannot follow. I did the exerecises and read over and over and still find it jumping from entry level to very advanced stuff. so.. given the context of the subject matter, the title indicates this is done the ""hard way"" but in the title there is also a phase that indicates this is a very simple introduction to the world of computers and code.. I think when we write or sell and instruction book, we need to stay at the level it is intended and consider the buyer and the level of his skills and STICK with that concept. I seriously doubt you can write a book which has the intent of teaching Python from the ground up and then jump off into OOP. I would have preferred to kept going with basic programming and then bought a more advanced book when I felt the need. Sorry.. half the book is a waste of my time. I was going to give this rating a 1 but consider the good value in the first half of the book. I'll keep it as a reference.

"It's a decent book. I also read his previous version with python2, however its all or more the same. He defines the ""hard way"" as typing things in yourself, which I actually like. However outside of this, he leaves a lot of guessing and doesn't do the best job at explaining things. Hell, in exercise 40 he even states that ""Keep in mind that I’m giving you a slightly inaccurate idea of how these work so that you can start to build up an understanding of classes "". So he really takes a roundabout way into topics, and leaves a lot of open ended things from the students perspective. You will do many exercises without explanation and the reassurance that ""we will explain this later, don't worry, but just type in the code and trust me"".Wouldn't recommend this book to most learners, there are better options out there.

"I've tried multiple tutorials from multiple sources (Udemy, Lynda, Tuts+, Codecademy, YouTube, etc.), but none of them compare to the LP3THW method.  You'll get your hands dirty right away by diving straight into the exercises from the very beginning.  You're not bogged down with a ton of theory up front.  Instead the theory is gradually revealed as you progress through each exercise.  Unfortunately there is one down side, if you want the accompanying videos, you will still need to purchase directly from his website.  The Kindle version doesn't provide access to any of the online videos.  I know many reviewers wrote negative reviews because of this, but it's how Zed has things set up.

"Shaw's ""hard way"" is the way that I learned to code as an 8-year-old in the early '90s, and the way that my dad learned to code in the '70s. It means that you type in code, character-by-character, from what is printed in the book, not necessarily fully understanding what it's going to do or why. Then, once you have it working, there is an explanation of how the code works. Basically rote memorization drills paired with learning the associated concepts. It can be tedious at times, but it works well.This book is absolutely appropriate for someone with no coding experience. Someone who has learned a language before will probably already be familiar with many of the concepts, but it's still ok if you are willing to tolerate a little bit that.The drawback for me is that a big portion of the book has you writing small Zork-style games in order to practice the skills that you're learning. It's just not something that I am interested in at all, and I've had a little bit of trouble pushing my way through that stuff.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaws Hard Way Series)
If this will be the only resource you have then it is not a good way to learn Python. It requires lots of supplementation even when using the accompanying videos on the publisher's website. This book is good for getting a feel for coding the extremely simple stuff but doesn't place emphasis on what you should be calling things except in a few fringe cases. Once you get to exercise 43 the book is basically useless because it expects you to already be able to code object-oriented programming (OOP) somehow but also has barely even explained it.As a beginner in order to complete the exercise in the manner prescribed in the book you will have to look up tons of external material in order to learn OOP which effectively makes the book pointless at that point since it isn't teaching you anything.It really feels like there were supposed to be more exercises before exercise 43 but constraints or laziness prevented the author from adding them.That said for an absolute beginner it is fine from exercise 1 - 42 as long as you supplement with outside material such as youtube videos in order to actually learn what the book is trying to teach you.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaws Hard Way Series)
"I don't like how often the book says ""Look {this} up online."" If this is going to be a teaching method in the book, they could at least point me toward a site that provides reliable, up to date information (Yes, I know this is difficult in print because websites change). I bought this book to teach me the material, not to tell me to look things up online. They could give a brief definition, so that at least when you look something up online you can verify that the online source agrees with the book, and is just providing more detail.The author also uses built in python methods without explaining what they are. I'm coming from c++, where generally if a function is called it is explicitly written somewhere, so I was searching back through the book looking to see if it was written somewhere I missed. I finally looked it up online. Since the author likes to use ""Look this up online,"" as a teaching method, ""Look up {this} built in python method"" online would have been helpful.Other than what I consider unacceptable missing information, I like the style of the book and it is very easy to understand and follow.

"Right off the bat I'm going to say - this book does NOT teach you Day 1 Infrastructure as Code (eg. Terraform, ARM Templates, AWS CF) - for that I would highly recommend Terraform in Action, by Scott Winkler.What this book DOES provide is a deep dive on Day 2 Operationalization of IaC in an enterprise. This includes not only how to modularize your IaC scripts, but also how to work in a multi-engineer environment, helping avoid many of the pitfalls that those learning on their own may otherwise fall into.I would highly recommend this book as a resource for guiding organizations in the sustainable use of IaC going forward.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Infrastructure as Code Patterns and Practices: With examples in Python and Terraform

"I've found that trying to translate principles from a programming book from one language to another is very difficult. So while I've read several books that talk about these principles in Java, they really didn't hit home until I could see them concretely applied in Python. I've read this book cover-to-cover at least four times and have dramatically improved my application architecture practices as a result. It's been a lot of work, weeks of nights and weekends, but really fun and very empowering.I was already good at module and class/object interface design and already a test-driven developer, but this book has brought me up to good layer design, and I can now think of composing a whole application from a relatively small number of main chunks, like a REST API or a CLI or an event-loop, a service layer, some repositories and other adapters as needed, all around a clearly bounded domain model.The other big advancement for me was moving from a GOOS TDD discipline to a Classical TDD discipline, which has both halved (or more) the work in developing tests at the same time the tests become more ""vivid"", like showing how a particular service actually works.So the time I spent with this book rewarded me very greatly. If you develop Python applications for a living I recommend you check it out. If it seems appealing in any way, buy it. My initial attraction was concrete examples of using the Repository Pattern, but once I started I got pulled in bit by bit until I wanted ALL of it :) If you think it's too advanced for your current level of play, I recommend you buy it anyway and visit it from time to time to grow into it. Sooner or later, if you're developing commercial-scale systems, you're going to self-inflict the pain that the practices in this book can remedy for you.Triple thumbs up, would absolutely do it again and recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development Domain-Driven Design and Event-Driven Microservices
"Authors:  Harry J.W. Percival, Bob GregoryPublisher:  O'ReillyPublication Date:  3/5/2020Disclaimer: I am reviewing my own copy of this book because I want to.  The publisher did not provide me with a copy. I promise to be 100% honest in how I feel about this book, both the good and the less so.About the BookThis is an introductory software engineering book that gives you more hand-on experience than your typical software engineering course.  The authors discuss domain-driven design, test-driven development, the basic concepts of object-oriented programming, and general software architecture.  It's broken up into two parts:  Building an Architecture to Support Domain Modeling and Event-Driven Architecture, with a bit extra thrown in at the end to fill in some gaps.  This is an unofficial follow up to one author's previous book, Test-Driven Design in Python.The first half, on building the architecture, gives you a high level view of your software and about setting it up for success.  It starts with an introduction to domain modelling, discusses basic architecture patterns, and gives examples of the Flask API.  It finishes with setting up your tests and being ready to add the meat to the bones.  The second half, on event-driven architecture, looks at event handling and the message bus that serves of the backbone of your application.Who is This For and Why Was it Written?In the preface, the authors claim that you are an experienced Python developer who has developed applications with at least a moderate amount of complexity, You have realized how difficult this can be, but you don't know much if anything about Domain Driven Design or basic architecture patterns.I would expand this to a slightly wider audience.  If you're an advanced undergraduate who has spent their university career working in Python and were not satisfied with your Software Engineering course, this book is for you.  If you are about to create your own open source project with even the slightest bit of complexity, this book is for you.  If you want to work on or take over an abandoned open source project, this book is for you.  There are other people this is for, but I'll end the list here.I would argue that this book fills a gap left by a LOT of software engineering books.  First, it gives you a hands-on experience, so long as you follow the code.  Second, is discusses patterns that I never learned in my software engineering course.  Third, it gives a good introduction to microservices, which are common right now.OrganizationThe first part of the book begins as soon as the introduction ends.  Half way through the book, they leave the architecture and look at the code running within that architecture.  Then it finishes with a series of appendices that fill in missing bits, expand on important topics, or give alternatives to how the main parts of the book handled this topic.  One example is how to use Django rather than Flask to achieve the same results.Within a chapter, there are a page or two that gives you a high level view of the upcoming text.  Each chapter comes in at 15-25 pages of clear written prose.  Then they finish up with a Wrap-Up (Summary) section where they review what you just read while also giving you a taste of what is to come.Did This Book Succeed?I think that this book does very well.  As someone who wants to write their own large program without knowing where to start (like so many of us), I picked up this book at just the right time.  It's not going to teach you all of software engineering (which they did not claim to do), nor is it going to teach you Python.  This is an intermediate level book who want to expand their developer's toolbox.  t was well organized, well written, and very much needed, as one of the few books of its kind.Rating and Final ThoughtsThis is a great book, which earns a 5 out of 5.  It's the book I need the most right now, as it will let me step up with my Python development.  I very much hope that the authors consider collaborating again for a design pattern book for Python.  I would expect it to be as well organized and written.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development Domain-Driven Design and Event-Driven Microservices
"Many python developers may start with a simple idea in mind: python is easy to learn and use. They are right. Compare to many older programming languages, python allows you a quick start to build something useful. However, that also means that a lot of python developers can be less trained on those important programming principles. I have seen many people using python as quick and dirty ways to develop product in a professional environment because they don't know better. I have done similar things too. This book provides a concrete example to guide you on the path to develop a well designed product.  In contrast to some programming book, in which high level concept is introduced, this book does it from bottom up. It starts with common design mistakes and correct them through the chapters.This is not a book for python starters. If you haven't had the need to design a product or a python module, or you haven't had the basic understanding of python, you may find this book difficult. In that case, you might want to start with Fluent Python.That been said, if you are a python developer and are asking yourself ""what do I do to design a good product"", I would strongely recommend this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development Domain-Driven Design and Event-Driven Microservices

"I actually tried getting through this book once before, when it was first released. But I wasn't experienced enough with the supporting frameworks, like SqlAlchemy, for this material to really hit home. Fast forward a couple years, with another Python application on my plate, it seemed like there weren't any newer books which looked at project architecture specifically in Python through a DDD/TDD lens. (You might want to check out Giordani's Clean Architectures in Python although its not as extensive as this book.) So I gave Harry and Bob another look.  And wow!  This is really a comprehensive gem.Most design decisions are presented as the better of some number of alternatives, and they discuss each in a very easy-to-understand (and somewhat humorous) manner. So if your project doesn't exactly mirror theirs, there's still a lot of worthwhile takeaways from the book.Some minor criticism... they change the project a lot, i mean A LOT throughout the book. I get that its supposed to mimic how you might refactor as you develop, and there's a git repo with code broken down by chapters. But if you're going back to this as a reference to find how they structured things, it may be a bit confusing as parts are getting moved around with every chapter. I wish they would have spent more time on using aggregates rather than a single entity, but maybe for a newer edition?Also I realize that I'm probably in the small minority who's not using a web frontend, but I wished there was at least some discussion about how to integrate a more traditional UI.They say clearly up front that this is not a DDD book and that you NEED to read a DDD book. Don't overlook that imperative if you're newer to the concept (Vernon's ""red book"" is what I found to be most helpful, but Millett and Tune's PPP of DDD is a close second). This book shows how you can use all of those theoretical concepts in a test-driven/test-first project.TL;DR:  If you're building applications in Python, this is THE book you need. It may not be a light read, but all the information is in here.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development Domain-Driven Design and Event-Driven Microservices
"I have always bought books that try to teach theoretical design patterns. They made sense when i read them, but when I try to implement them I get stuck.## This teaches theory in a highly practical wayMy experience is completely the OPPOSITE here compared with most theoretical books.This book is highly practical. In fact, it's so practical, I am highly motivated to re-read certain chapters of this book several times. I have made plenty of notes as well. See the images. Many highly theoretical books, I read once, cannot implement, then put them aside. This includes many 5-star rated books. My experience is entirely different for this book.## Gradual evolution of architecture across chapters using diagramsAnother good thing about this book is that it shows you the gradual evolution of the architectural patterns across multiple chapters using diagrams of the overall structure. This is very useful as I am a visual person. It makes me feel that I can grok their suggestions but also the reasons behind their suggestions.## No BS. They emphasize tradeoffsMany architectural / highly theoretical books either don't talk abt tradeoffs or they simply note that tradeoffs happen and then handwave it to move onto stuff the authors like to talk about.No such thing here. They go deep into the weeds.Almost every chapter that covers a new pattern, they will have at least one pros and cons table summarizing the various options. Some chapters have more than one pros and cons because there are multiple key decision points. And the authors go in to explore the full range of options. And then weigh them for you.It feels like they are right there besides you coaching you step by small step.## Is this suitable for Django people?Yes!I'm currently using Django professionally for a project that accounts to 50% of my revenue. I expect to be 100% by end of the year. I have been using Django since early 2018 (~2 years). And then I come across this book.So I say this as an actual Django developer with real stakes: this book is one of the most important software design books in my career. I'm already trying to implement one of the suggestions inside (CQRS). I fully expect to revisit the book several times.However, do note that the authors (Harry and Bob) are more familiar with Flask. So they write this with Flask in mind. They did seek out experienced Django people to review their book and they wrote up an appendix D to show how you can implement some of their main patterns using Django and why.So yes, you may need some effort to make this work for you in Django, but it's possible.Remember this book teaches you new ways to architect. So it's not a copy-paste teaching in the first place. You have to adapt it to your context even if you use Flask.Nevertheless, this book is so useful because they really go deep into the whys and hows. Which excites me enough to put in extra effort to make some of the patterns work for my Django projects. That doesn't happen for most software books I read.I recommend go slow, take small steps, and pick the low hanging fruit in your python (Flask or Django) project to adopt some of the patterns.For me, initially there were a few 2 steps forward 1 step back in terms of adapting. But I see that as part of the learning process. I spoke earlier that I am now adopting some aspects of CQRS  in my Django app. The next move for me is likely the adoption of Domain Entity while keeping the Django ActiveRecord ORM pattern. I'll see how it goes.But I am excited and looking forward to that experiment. Thanks to this book!## AfterwordThis is my second review because my first one got rejected.I don't have verified purchase because I needed a hardcopy and I got mine from some other online seller due to shipping costs reasons.If you still are hesitant despite being a Python web developer, I recommend searching for sample chapters that are available by the authors. In fact, it was those sample chapters that tipped the balance for me to buy the hardcopy.Easily the best purchase for me this 2020.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development Domain-Driven Design and Event-Driven Microservices
"Percival and Gregory have a gift for explaining their subject clearly and at the right level of detail. Beyond that, they have an uncanny knack for well timed, “now you might be thinking [x]” when a particularly counter-intuitive idea is presented. They describe why they themselves where initially skeptics, then explain how experiencing first-hand the concrete benefits (testability, clarity about different roles within the system and where new evolving elements should live, design flexibility and separation of the right concerns) ultimately won them over.I especially appreciated that the challenges of trying to apply new design principles to an existing codebase is discussed directly. An appendix item from one of the technical reviewers starts with the admission “when the nice theory of a book meets the reality of your codebase, it can be demoralizing”. This form of heartbreak has been common in my experience: after being convinced of the benefits of some ideal design but with no path to get there through intermediate steps, I'm left feeling defeated, and somehow at fault. This book does a unusually good job with suggesting concrete tactics to apply subsets of the principles in small steps.Summary of strengths:* Excellent writing* Appropriate scope* Thought provoking++* Demonstrates that building in flexibility does not mean a lot speculative design and piles of code up front* Many references to other great resources",5.0 out of 5 stars,Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development Domain-Driven Design and Event-Driven Microservices

"The book has has an excellently laid out structure. Although, it does say that the book is not for beginners, I feel like it is - which is a good thing as more people would be able to understand the book. The content covered seems comprehensive and it is well written. Topics covered are highly useful for someone starting python.That being said, I also have some concerns. The book sometimes tends to use redundant words - again not a bad thing. For example, in the numpy chapter, I read something like “numpy.ndarray object is implemented in C and offers a very fast and memory-efficient array. It can be represented as a single-dimension array or a multi-dimensional matrix ”. We already established the fact that numpy is fast and is written in C, why would you repeat it again for a function of numpy? Another thing, if you look at it, arrays are always single dimension. The moment we add one more dimension to an array, it becomes a matrix and similarly, a single dimension matrix is nothing but an array. In mathematics, we tend to treat things as matrices and vectors - so I can essentially treat vectors as arrays in python - if you get the idea. Now, this is not a bad thing because, beginners might not be knowing this - so although this seems to be extra information - it’s in good taste.I also noticed that the book sometimes over-explains some topics like one above and sometimes under-explains a topic. For example for the same numpy chapter, There is a point where the book says, calculations on matrices is much faster/efficient. My question is why is it so?Other than these small caveats (which probably won’t change anything from a reader’s perspective), the book is very good. Only thing, I didn’t like is that how the book handles the ML/AI chapters. It’s not the worst thing I’ve seen, but it’s certainly not the best. The book relies on definitions and code without talking about the underlying mathematics. You can’t just completely obliterate all the mathematics, even if the book was for beginners. There’s no machine learning without mathematics and if you’re covering it, you should cover numerical algebra and probability theory. For the most part, I feel like this AI/ML chapter could be a completely different book, but that’s just my opinion - the book provides a good enough introductory code but again, unfortunately, I don’t like it.There are few more small things which might make this book seem unpolished, but I think I have already said too much and most of those things would be considered nitpicking, I guess. So, in conclusion, the book is great, great insights, well structured and comprehensive. A few things here and there can be touched upon and they can make it perfect.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Python: Write powerful and efficient code using the full range of Pythons capabilities 2nd Edition

You will learn how to write Python code correctly, use object-oriented and functional programming methods, test and debug your application, and more. It even touches on machine learning and how to use C and C++ code in your Python application for better performance.This book will give you a solid grounding in the Python language so you will be ready to tackle more advanced Python projects.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Python: Write powerful and efficient code using the full range of Pythons capabilities 2nd Edition
"I have been using Python for eight years and read dozens of books on the topic. Mastering Python covers all that you would hope for and then some. I was constantly and pleasantly surprised by the authors ability to go deep and wide into the topics covered. I learned a lot of tricks and nuances that I had never heard before which was refreshing.The book did feel like a bit of a brain dump at times which made it difficult to follow.I agree with the other reviewers that those just getting started with programming and Python may find this book a bit overwhelming, but intermediate to advanced Pythonistas should get a lot out of it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Python: Write powerful and efficient code using the full range of Pythons capabilities 2nd Edition
"The second edition of Mastering Python is a hefty beast weighing in at 18 chapters and around 600 pages of content. It covers a wide range of topics in Python including philosophy, advanced class design, performance, multithreading, documentation, testing, and specialized uses of Python for data science and AI.This is a book that's going to best help two types of people:- If you're a few years in on Python and want to see what else the language can do, this book is going to push you to new heights- If you're coming to Python from another programming language, this will help you transfer your skills and knowledge by frequently relating concepts to concepts in other languages and orienting you to the Pythonic way of doing things.As an expert .NET developer expanding my knowledge into Python, I fall firmly into the second profile. I learned many new aspects of Python from reading this book. Additionally, in the data science areas where I'm strongest in Python, the book surprised me by introducing me to a library or two I hadn't heard of (and now plan on using in my next project).However, this is not a book for everyone. If you are starting out in Python, this book is too advanced for you and skips covering the basics of the Python language in lieu of a focus on more advanced areas. Start with other books, courses, and projects, then come back to this book.My only gripes with the book are that many of the code samples are screenshots with white text on black backgrounds. On my printing this was fine, but it could lead to misprints. I also would have liked to have seen one or two quiz style questions at the end of each chapter to help cement concepts, but the book is already long enough.This is a book at has earned its place on my bookshelf as a reference book as I continue to drill deeper into Python. I definitely recommend it, and encourage you to read it in random order in the areas most of interest to you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Python: Write powerful and efficient code using the full range of Pythons capabilities 2nd Edition
"The book takes a very comprehensive approach in discussing about various topics in a structured way. It is more targeted towards someone who already nailed down the basics and want to learn and use python in an actual project. The introduction to Environment and Interpertetters was very well put together.The overall structure of the book caught me off guard though. I wish there was more emphasis on unit testing, packaging and C++ extensions earlier in the book before dealing with AI and ML. This my personal take as a Django Developer.In the debugging chapter, I wish the author talks about ipdb in depth instead of just a couple of pages. Nevertheless the number of topics covered in the book from Unit Testing to Tensorflow was really good for a intermediate level book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Python: Write powerful and efficient code using the full range of Pythons capabilities 2nd Edition
"I learned quite a bit from this book. I don't use Python often, so this is certainly one that I'll keep as a reference.It has a ton of valuable content about the language, common pitfalls, design patterns, testing, performance, multi-processing, and much more.My favorite chapter is 17 which covers ctypes, CFFF, and writing native C/C++ to extend Python.Definitely worth checking out.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Python: Write powerful and efficient code using the full range of Pythons capabilities 2nd Edition
"Overall a great book.  It is quite comprehensive.  It touches many different aspects of Python, from environment/package management, to various language features, to docstrings, type hinting and testing, and so on.  I think it is a great book for Python users who would like to learn about advanced features that they are not familiar with and get introduced to those features.  Although the book sometimes does not go very deep in each topic, it provides a good starting point for further learning (e.g., from online resources).I'm also glad that the book is updated and contains various relatively new features and tools such as type hinting, poetry (for environment and package management), etc., and that it has a whole chapter on machine learning.One major drawback:IMO the book does not dedicate enough chapters to object-oriented programming.  To ""master"" Python, I assume that some people would like to build large and complex projects.  The features described in the book are great for mastering ""Python programming"", but OO is important to medium- to large-scale software engineering projects using Python.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Python: Write powerful and efficient code using the full range of Pythons capabilities 2nd Edition
"Let me just say this first: the material in the book itself is worth 6 stars. It's second to none in its quality. This goes for all Murach books, 5 of which I own. The one reason however, that I've ranked this book and a few of their other books (made after their HTML5/CSS3 book) a 4 is that it seems like they've changed the thickness and quality of the paper the pages are printed on. I've noticed with the newer books that because the pages are thinner, if you like to take notes and highlight like myself, that everything tends to bleed through the pages and look bad. To be fair, I would rank this product a 4.8 if I could, removing a fifth of a star for this downside. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest learning languages from anything but a Murach book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Murachs Python Programming

"If you're trading for your own account or managing portfolios for other investors, the insights in this book are priceless. As a short seller, Bernut's methods shine in market crashes especially. But long only managers have much to learn from what's in this book.As Ken Grant noted in ""Trading Risk,"" every manager needs to make sure at least some part of the portfolio does better when the benchmark sinks. And that's a big part of what is addressed here.About two thirds of the book is NOT about short-selling, but about making any trading system better. Bernut provides a set of rational, step by step methods for developing, deploying, monitoring and improving your best ideas for trading systems.Here are a few highlights:If you ask 10 traders what their edge is, 8 of them will tell you a story instead. Winners and professionals quantify that edge and their strategy (pp 109 - 133)I liked the refreshingly frank talk about what your stops should be and how they should be enforced. Operational Risk (the chance of a manager making a mistake) is the largest risk among individuals and you'll find solid measures here to shore up weaknesses to improve your results quantifiably (pp134-169).If you're still using the ""2% risk per trade heuristic,"" you really need to understand your peril better. Especially true in times of market chaos, position sizing is the link between your financial and your emotional capital. (pp171-202)ABOUT THE PROGRAMMING PART:  I have only a passing knowledge of Python, therefore much of the real gold is hidden from me so far. The narrative itself is enough to provide a good guide. However, if you have been moved, as I have, to study and learn to program in order to automate what can be automated, there is even more value here with code supplied through GitHub and color graphics available through the publishers website.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Algorithmic Short Selling with Python: Refine your algorithmic trading edge consistently generate investment ideas and build a robust long/short product

"This is honestly my first ever Amazon book review.  I've read close to 50 trading/investing books over the past few years.  This book stands out though and moved me to write this.  “Algorithmic Short Selling With Python” is superbly written and overflowing with practical ideas of how to approach the market with a risk-aware, volatility-controlled portfolio management mindset.  Laurent Bernut is clearly someone with solid experience in the trading world.  It is evident in his descriptions of how the markets function and how participants think and behave.  His ideas about viewing trading instruments from a relative perspective versus absolute are an exciting departure from other authors I’ve read.I'm a retail trader. This book is geared toward professional portfolio managers, but I can see how this will massively improve how I approach the markets.  From what I’ve read, incorporating short selling is something most serious traders should consider.  There is an oft vilified side of the market where excess returns can be made and overall equity curve improved/smoothed. I’ve dabbled but never understood how to do sell short properly.  Mr. Bernut lays out, in methodical detail, how to accomplish this in a fresh/innovative way.  Incorporating Python to help take the emotions out of the trading equation is huge.  He provides the ideas and the actual code to play with and test for yourself.  You don’t need to be a coding genius but do need to have an interest in coding to get the most out of it.  The book is still worth the read even if you have no interest in coding.  You’ll more than likely take something away that will improve your results on the long or short side.  The trading journey is iterative.  I've read the book twice already and each time take away more.  Did I mention the book is entertaining as well?  The author's sense of humor is right up my alley.

However, if you are more interested in short side, you'll gain some knowledge that are best presented here.Although you might feel the book is written more towards portfolio managers rather than retail traders, the entire system and rules described can be deployed for retailers as well. He breaks down the main components that a trading system needs to have into well defined modules and discusses each one carefully.

"I had waited patiently for this book to be published, but when it was released I was too busy to read it. I finally got around to buying and reading, so here goes. This is an outstanding book for anyone who is involved in systematic or algorithmic trading, as I am. Laurent Bernut is well-known on Quora as an expert in short-selling, but this book is for anyone who trades (or wants to trade) algorithmically or systematically.  Forget the title. Bernut makes a case for short-selling as part of a holistic approach to trading, but this is more than a short-seller's tome. Forget about Python for a moment. This book is for all of us algo traders.Be warned, this is not a beginner's book. Don't buy this book if you have no idea what you are doing in the market and are looking for a holy grail system. This is a 'level-up' book, to use a video gaming term. There are some advanced topics, but they are made accessible to the rest of us mortals. Bernut weaves his knowledge into this book, with analogy, humor, conventional, and not-so-conventional wisdom. And one or two boxing reference. The man is brilliant and funny.If and when you are ready to move to Python, the source code is readily available. The book was peer reviewed by Sofien Kaabar, a fellow, tireless systematic trader who has published numerous articles and books on automated trading with Python, so I know the content is solid.I guarantee you will find something in this book that will be worth the price you paid.

"Packt sent me an advance copy to review.This book is a good resource for learning fastAPI. I think it bears mentioning that this book assumes that the reader already knows Python, understands web development, and is generally looking for a way to develop a fastAPI website. For example, it runs through ""routers"" without really defining them, brushes over Model-View-Controller concepts assuming that the reader already knows them, and shows GET/POST/UPDATE/DELETE requests without extensive explanation. The author also uses CURL to test new functions vs rendering basic HTML templates. This may be off-putting to less experienced readers.If ""understands web development and wants to learn fastAPI specifically"" describes you as a reader, then I think this is a good book. It goes over basic Create-Read-Update-Delete server functions, advanced user registration and database applications, native documentation, SQL and noSQL databases, and more. The author shows good examples that make sense, since I often find that resources use highly specific examples that don't help a broader reader understand. Crucially, the book also covers deploying and testing, two areas that aren't usually discussed when learning a web framework.I did find a few Python anti-patterns in some places (like using *for i in range(len(some_list))* when *enumerate()* would do the same thing), but they did not detract from the book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Building Python Web APIs with FastAPI: A fast-paced guide to building high-performance robust web APIs with very little boilerplate code

"I think the conceptual descriptions in the book appear to be good, but there appear to be a large number of technical errors that make the book lack credibility.I ran into significant technical issues in the very first chapter.  The Dockerfile given is invalid and when documenting how to use uvicorn it stated to use port 8000 when creating the server and then to use curl to write to port 8080 to communicate to the server.  These things just don't work and leave the reader frustrated.The Docker file had ""FROM PYTHON:3.8"" which will not be accepted by Docker, at least on Centos 7 Linux and I imagine that is true generally.  It needed to be ""FROM python:3.8"".  If you try to build a Docker image using that Dockerfile, it simply fails.At one point it indicates the URL of the created web server is http://0.0.0.0:8000 and then later indicates it is http://127.0.0.1:8080.  In order to have '0.0.0.0' it is necessary to use the '--host 0.0.0.0' qualifier for the uvicorn program.

For example, chapter 05 starts talking about the model for NewUser which isn't actually defined anywhere nor in the GitHub repository. In earlier chapters, the author seems to get himself confused also with the models with various issues and quite clumsy naming, etc. However, I do like the book but it's a bit rough around the edges.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Building Python Web APIs with FastAPI: A fast-paced guide to building high-performance robust web APIs with very little boilerplate code
buy this book,5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Cybersecurity: Using Python for Cyber Offense and Defense
"I would give this book 2-1/2 stars, if Amazon would let me give half-stars.  It's not ""bad"", it's just focused almost exclusively on cybersecurity *for* *Microsoft* *Windows* systems, and how each example might map back to an attacker goal/technique denoted within the MITRE ATT&CK framework (also, not ""bad"", per se).Python is PLATFORM INDEPENDENT, yet the examples from this book focus on using Python within the Windows execution environment, often requiring various Windows facilities (WMI, autorun, the Windows registry, Windows logging, and the like) that do not exist on Linux systems.  This makes many of the examples irrelevant, as Linux underpins the entire Internet.Chapter 5 - ""Performing Privilege Escalation"" does not demonstrate this topic. It does show how you could inject malicious Python libraries somewhere within your own PYTHONPATH, but does not talk about how this could be used to achieve privilege escalation.Having said all of that, the examples that are provided would seem to work in a Windows environment, and are designed to attack and defend a Windows system.  The book is rather short, but each example seems to deliver on its goal of demonstrating a Windows-based attack and defense using Python - mostly by running a Python library and (very brief/limited) script from within that same Windows system.  (This is know as running an ""agent"" on a protected/targeted device.)  In summation, the book does provide value, but that value is rather lean, Microsoft-Windows centric, agent-based, and couched against definitions laid out by the MITRE Corporation's ""ATT&CK framework"".  Perhaps renaming this book would help to better set the expectations of prospective buyers.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Cybersecurity: Using Python for Cyber Offense and Defense

"Not much to dislike here guys! It's good to have some basic knowledge of python in hand.  However, if you don't just take it one chapter at a time. It's worth it!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking Codes with Python: An Introduction to Building and Breaking Ciphers
"Full Disclosure: I solicited Mr. Sweigart for an eBook copy of this book for review purposes. This was AFTER purchasing the original Hacking Secret Ciphers book for Python 2 around 3 years ago and AFTER purchasing a physical copy of Cracking Codes immediately upon release based solely on my love for the previous installment. If it makes you feel any better, he got me the eBook months ago, and I'm dreadfully late on my review.I'm a huge fan of Mr. Sweigart's work. I found Hacking Secret Ciphers to be a brilliant primer on basic Python programming practices, and find that it has only been refined and updated in Cracking Codes. Many friends have expressed an interest in what I do and asked me where to begin to learn programming concepts, and I frequently point them toward Python and Mr. Sweigart's resources.Cracking Codes walks you through several different methods of encoding messages with different ciphers using the Python programming language. From a simple Caesar cipher all the way through an implementation of the textbook RSA cipher. He walks you through from basic data types and decision structures through loops, data structures, common Python modules, and other advanced concepts. You read from and write to files, and learn to powerfully process and transform text with Python.I frequently use Hacking Secret Ciphers/Cracking Codes and Automate The Boring Stuff as references for writing basic Python programs. They're outstanding resources, and it's a joy to go back through Cracking Codes, retype all the exercises, and troubleshoot them until they run. The diff tool on Mr. Sweigart's InventWithPython site is a godsend, and the ability to run the source code to see what my code should look like when it executes has helped me pass many a roadblock.I don't quite understand how every cipher works or why it's difficult to hack, but I do generally get what each program is doing at any given point, and you can, too. If you don't quite get cryptography, this is also a neat way to look under the hood and get some of the basic concepts. It's pretty wild to see a computer hack a cipher in seconds that would take a human hours, days, or months -- if they could solve it at all.An excellent and entertaining book of exercises. I wholeheartedly suggest it, especially for teens and adults interested in computer science and programming. Thank you for another great book, Mr. Sweigart!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking Codes with Python: An Introduction to Building and Breaking Ciphers

"Cracking Codes with Python is a fantastic introduction to the Python programming language -- and coding in general -- using the super-fun theme of codebreaking. What's especially fun about this approach is that you can use these secret codes to send messages to your friends -- it's way better than invisible ink. As a student of computer history, I really appreciated the historical context provided for why codebreaking and ciphers are so important to the history of computers and technology. It's also great that the book provides a companion website with answers to all the practice problems at the end of each chapter, so that you can easily check your work.I've recommended this book to folks who want to learn to code, and I'll keep doing so!

"I like the book itself and teaching Python through cryptography is definitely a different approach to the subject that I found to be entertaining. You can also tell the author cares about the subject and moves through teaching Python via simple and historical ciphers up to the more modern. The book does not go into OOP, but there are plenty of materials that cover it so that is forgivable especially as this format is written to be more available to a wider audience. It doesn't require the dedication of getting through some much more thorough texts such as Learning Python.I was very happy with the ebook edition that I received from the author at my request in order to provide a review. I ended up purchasing the printed version since I tutor an introductory programming course and the examples would be relevant, but far enough away from what they would be working on for assignments.Big disappointment! The paper is so thin and the ghosting is horrible. I've never gotten a printed book from No Starch that felt so cheaply made. You can see the words on the back of the page very clearly!

Each succeeding chapter introduces more and more complex and useful language constructs, each of which is identified in the accompanying text and clearly explained.  Indeed, it is the use of constructs like lists and dictionaries that make Python the very valuable and powerful scripting tool that it is.As a Code Cracking tutorial, it is, as declared in the book sub-title, an ""Introduction"".  You'll see how various algorithmic strategies can be used against comparatively simple ciphers.  The techniques include frequency analysis, word pattern matching and dictionary tests for decrypted text.But the book is more about Learning Python than it is about Cracking Codes.

"This book fit my situation well. I'm pretty comfortable with python but had not done any webscraping, and have a specific research project on my plate right now that requires deeper-than-google web research. The author wastes very little time trying to teach the reader python, but does provide small, mostly-clean code examples to show the proper syntax and python structures that are the best suited for the scraping and database modules that the book is based on.The read is quick, because the author structured the book so only the first half of the books is ""required reading.""

It was hard for a beginner to understand all these regular expressions,  import packages, and different html/css formats just by staring at the code. It was frustrating whenever I saw a page-long section of code being slapped right onto my face with very superficial explanation on implementation details.

All code is, as it should be, in the current Python 3.Some background, last year I taught myself John Zelle’s excellent ‘Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science’ and continued with Head First Python.  These books are excellent if you are new to programming or new to Python.  I had two programming classes as an undergraduate in college but that was 20 years ago.  In the last 6 months, I’ve read Dasgupta’s excellent ‘Algorithms’, the UC Berkeley and UC San Diego Algorithms textbook, which demands considerable Math.This ‘Data Structures & Algorithms in Python’ textbook includes everything in Sedgewich’s excellent ‘Algorithms’ (Java-oriented) textbook (Object-Oriented Programming, Algorithm Analysis and Design, Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Sorting, Searching, Graphs, Strings, Pattern Matching, etc.).  Best of all this textbook is dedicated to Python.  As a Data Scientist, I want to become an expert at Python before moving on to Java or C++.

"This is on a very short list of programming books that have helped me the most.  Coming to it from where I was at, the first few exercises were easy, but pretty much every one after that took some thought, and hence, helped me to become more proficient.  I would say that most of the exercises took me more than ten minutes.  Not because they required long programs, but because it usually took me a bit of experimenting and/or research to figure out how to do the key thing properly.  All told, it took me about seven weeks to work my way through the book, working a few hours a day.I want to emphasize that Reuven Lerner explains things as well as anybody I have ever come across.  He gives you enough to get you started on most of the exercises, and then after you come up with your solution, and then you read his, you'll really start getting it.  I should emphasize that the book's title is spot-on; i.e., don't expect to read this book from cover to cover, or even a chapter a day.  You really have to put in the effort to solve each exercise, one at a time.The subtitle is a little misleading.  There are actually 200 exercises in this book.  Each of the 50 primary ones has three ""beyond the exercise"" exercises.  The solutions to the BTEs are not discussed in the book, but the solution code for each one is posted on GitHub, and that seems sufficient -- the BTEs don't so much introduce new concepts as they do go a little deeper on the new concept that just got illustrated in the main problem.Finally, there are also ""video walkthroughs"" that augment the explanation of some of the solutions.

This book gave me the confidence to take on Python projects I previously thought were out of my league.Python Workout reinforces a lot of foundational Python knowledge that anyone looking to become an expert in Python is going to need. I am thankful there are experienced professionals writing books such as this one; it really helps the general public level up its Python skills.I'm looking forward to Reuven's next book on Python (if he decides to write another).P.S. To get the most out of this book, please try to understand the reasoning and logic used to get to the solution. We'll always have to look up documentation for clarity, but the core concepts are the key takeaways. Always try to come up with your own solution before checking Reuven's solution.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Workout: 50 ten-minute exercises

Even if you *think* you write “Pythonic” code, Reuven shows that there’s usually a way to things even shorter and cleaner.The exercises focus on being short, but they always come with an “beyond the exercise” section with suggestions on how to put in some extra practice when desired.Finally, the book has a light-hearted tone that makes it eqsy to digest, even when you’re tired after a day of working.

"I’m a ""garage project"" type of programmer. I like to piddle and play with things that interest me, including automating my investment spreadsheets, programming my drone to recognize certain objects (thanks, PyImageSearch.com!), calculating how long it takes my Polaris pool vacuum to cover my pool’s surface, etc. So, this book was right up my alley.There are 12 chapters covering an eclectic collection of projects. Not all will appeal to everyone, but I found more than enough to keep me interested and busy. You can attempt to solve the problems on your own, or type-in or download the author’s code. The nice thing is that practically every line of code is addressed in the text, so if you encounter any new functions or commands, you don’t have to break off and search the internet. As an advanced beginner, I appreciated this, though it might come across as too much hand holding for intermediate or advanced users.The author assigns you a role in each chapter, like “NASA intern” or “Space Force tech,” to make the projects feel more relevant and interesting. They tend to have a fantastic feel, but at the core, they do address real-world problems, like applying Baye’s Rule, working with text data, scraping the web, manipulating images, decrypting ciphers, plotting charts, making maps from government data, and performing face detection and recognition.The book is very well written and provides interesting information besides the programming-related content. It also takes time to explain how methods like Bayes Rule, face detection, and face recognition work, which was cool. The basis for each is fairly straightforward but requires the blinding speed of modern computers to work.While the book walks you through installing third-party packages, it uses pip, rather than Anaconda. I took the author’s advice and set up a conda (virtual) environment for each chapter and used conda to install the packages. I guess the author didn’t want to force people to use Anaconda, but having a different environment for each project is the best course of action, and conda makes setting all this up really easy.One of the reviewers on the Amazon site says to Read this book and do the work. They’re right. This isn’t a learn-to-code-in-a-day book, it goes beyond the basic snippets. You can learn a lot of functions, packages, and techniques by sticking with it and patiently working through the chapters. I was really impressed with the Searching for Mars Landing Sites chapter. Never knew you could get so much info out of an image. Multiple chapters opened my mind to what you can do with Python. I highly recommend doing all the practice and challenge projects.

The projects are helpful and I've learned a lot doing them.The projects later on in the book are focused on data structures and algorithms and there are more code samples in that section.You also build a small ORM in the course of the book.What this book is really about, is teaching the reader a way to approach larger projects in an organized and thoughtful manner, and to track their successes and failures and use that information to improve their process and become a better programmer.If you're competent with Python but you're not sure what the next step is, this book could be helpful to you. It's more about using Python as a tool to investigate your own process, how you think and approach problems, than it is about showing you specific Python techniques. There are a hundred decent books that show you specific information, there are zero other books like this one (that I've found). Exactly what I needed.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learn More Python 3 the Hard Way: The Next Step for New Python Programmers (Zed Shaws Hard Way Series)
"That's not a book about Python, that's more about project development. I was not surprised to find similar template books for Ruby or C,  ""Learn Ruby/C the Hard Way"" by the same author. What about the specific ""Pythonic way"" every advanced Python programmer should learn about? Nothing here.It is extremely verbose, considering the whole book has just a few lines of actual code. It's also very pretentious, and you may get tired of that style ""with an attitude"": we're not all in high-school, and this guy is not our teacher.It's also basically for Linux, and if you're a Mac or Windows guy, not very useful. Most Python books are OS-independent.A full chapter is dedicated to writing SIMPLE SQL database statements. I agree any programmer should know something about this, but did you buy the book to waste your time on such simple use cases as those presented here?Finally, this looks more like a book of homework assignments, but for some pretty large projects (many of them). Do you really have time to practice on such large projects? Or are they really necessary, with such a huge waste of time, just to become more advanced in Python? I don't think so.There are other much better books for advanced Python and general software development. This is not one of them.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Learn More Python 3 the Hard Way: The Next Step for New Python Programmers (Zed Shaws Hard Way Series)

A broad and easy to understand introduction to scientific computing in python.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Scientific Computing with Python: High-performance scientific computing with NumPy SciPy and pandas 2nd Edition
"Full disclosure - I received a preprint copy of this ebook in order to be able to evaluate it.Overall, this book is a phenomenal resource, and covers a broad range of topics including linear algebra, data visualization, testing, symbolic computation, and parallel computing. There were clear trade-offs made between coverage and depth, and the level of expertise needed to fully appreciate each chapter can vary.For beginners, the introduction to types, functions, classes, arrays, and namespaces will be useful, and as a developer with >4 years of Python / scientific computing experience, I still learned things from those chapters.For the more advanced concepts, experience with both NumPy and math will greatly increase the utility of those chapters.  However, having proper coding solutions to complex mathematical problems makes this book truly a diamond in the rough, and the thorough explanations can help readers apply the same techniques to their own problems.For intermediate-advanced users, I thought that more could be done to touch on software design for scientific computing applications - when should something be an object with a method vs a function, and how can you efficiently handle many sets of moderate-sized data?  My conceptualization of scientific computing isn't just solving one complex problem once, but also efficiently handling internal problem states (e.g. with numerical solvers for DAEs, though this can apply to many other problem types).  However, I totally acknowledge that those high-level design guidelines could be outside the scope of this book.In summary, this book is a fantastic resource for hard-to-find information on blending the worlds of coding in Python and mathematical solutions, and any level coder will find value in the contents. Although some chapters focus on breadth over depth, enough information is provided that any resourceful reader will know what questions to ask on Stack Overflow for the next steps.I would recommend this book to any undergraduate / graduate student or software engineer looking to add scientific computing to their skill set.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Scientific Computing with Python: High-performance scientific computing with NumPy SciPy and pandas 2nd Edition
"As a professional working in data science, I had a chance to review Scientific Computing with Python: High-performance scientific computing with NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas. This book presents both beginner and intermediate concepts in scientific computing in a digestible way. Would recommend this book to anyone looking to learn not just the fundamentals of the language but also how the power of python can be used for real-world problem solving in computing.One of the main reasons people ""quit"" learning a new programming language is that they find the material too dry, boring, hard or non-relatable to real-life. With the inclusion of worked examples in day to day activity/problems, and simple, yet comprehensive explanations, this book does a good job of keeping the material interesting.The book does a great job of presenting concepts in object oriented programming, like datatypes, functions, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism so is a great book for anyone new to programming in general. There are no prerequisites required. In addition, the scipy, numpy, and pandas libraries are presented well and relate to the problems that they are being used to solveA limitation of this book is that while it goes over the three popular libraries, it could go further on talking about more visualization libraries (like matplotlib) and how to scale computing methods to larger amounts of data (convex optimization), although this is a more advanced concept in general.Overall, a great read and well worth the investment.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Scientific Computing with Python: High-performance scientific computing with NumPy SciPy and pandas 2nd Edition
"The book ""Scientific Computing with Python"" Second Edition by Claus Führer, Olivier Verdier, Jan Erik Solem, is perfect for both beginner-level and intermediate-level programmers, students, and python enthusiasts interested in the world of scientific computing and python. I can say that there are no pre-requisites for getting started. The book provides detailed, well-structured laid-out content making it easy for the reader to dive in with no hassle.The book provides a clear and simple introduction to the concepts in python programming like data types, variables, functions, classes, etc. This equips any reader with solid knowledge in programming by making them comfortable with python. The book also consists of necessary mathematical concepts like vectors, arrays, matrices, etc., providing the reader with a robust foundation to dive into the world of scientific computing.It provides the reader with knowledge of programming mathematical structures like arrays, vectors, etc., and doing mathematical operations on these structures in python using libraries like SciPy and NumPy. The reader is also introduced to the world of plotting using the Matplotlib library, which provides them with the knowledge of data visualization, interpretation of numbers, and data similar to the world of graphs in algebra.The authors then introduce the concepts of series and data frames using a library called Pandas, laying stepping stones to structured data, data science, and analysis. This enables the users with the knowledge of data concepts like rows, columns, filtering, aggregation, grouping, indices, etc.  It also consists of input-output handling concepts providing the users with reading and writing virtual files in various formats.For any good programmer, testing is a crucial concept for understanding how their code behaves under different environments. The authors introduced the concepts of manual testing, automatic and measurement of execution time. In the end, the authors take a simplistic approach to narrate advanced concepts likes Symbolic Computations using SymPy, Operating System, Shell Commands, Parallel Computing, and other Comprehensive examples providing the readers with an overall hands-on introduction to the Scientific Computing Universe.I personally recommend this book to anyone at any level and get started by creating wonderful things with the power of python. For the students and teachers, this book would be a great resource as a primary textbook or as a reference book for any python course.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Scientific Computing with Python: High-performance scientific computing with NumPy SciPy and pandas 2nd Edition
"This book can help you get started rapidly with using Python in scientific computation. It has detailed exposition on the basic syntax and data structures of Python. It also consists of advanced contents such as error handling, symbolic calculations and parallel computations. However, I wish it would focus more on numerical algorithms such as equation solving, matrix diagonalization, optimization, interpolation etc. Overall, it's a great book for those who are beginners in scientific computation with Python.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Scientific Computing with Python: High-performance scientific computing with NumPy SciPy and pandas 2nd Edition
"Full disclosure, I was given a copy of this book for review.  That being said, I will remain honest.I found this book to be written mainly for people with little to no background in computer science, and as such is an excellent resource for researchers who wish to expand their knowledge of Python and software engineering.  The examples should be familiar to students of mathematics, and connections between math and code are elaborated upon fully and clearly.This is also a good review book for those familiar with older versions of Python.I am docking one star due to the poor integration of mathematical symbols into the text.  In-line variables appear too high in the text.  Also, I would have appreciated bold-faced or colored font for keywords and such in code examples, which are monospaced plain text.The content itself is excellent.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Scientific Computing with Python: High-performance scientific computing with NumPy SciPy and pandas 2nd Edition
"Scientific Computing with Python is a great book for Python students aimed at an undergraduate level in university.The book covers the foundations of Python in the first few chapters which experienced programmers can easily skip over. But the heart of the content is indeed in 'scientific' programming focusing on NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas. If someone is planning to do research using Python then these three libraries are essential for getting the work done. Pandas is necessary for importing/exporting data and moving around easily in large datasets, NumPy has a lot of arithmetic and algebra operations making calculations easier, and SciPy is great for visualizing data.My favorite thing about the book is that the author uses Jupyter as the IDE which is a very easy and straightforward Python editor. The examples are easy to follow and practice and an experienced programmer can skip around the book to find code they can use in their work.I don't really have any complaints but I found that for a scientific book aimed at researchers and programmers the introductory chapters weren't really necessary but some might find them helpful.I wish I had this book when I started research in Bio Photonics as instead, I had to browse around dozens of websites to find the information that has been neatly arranged in this textbook.Overall, I would recommend this book to undergrad students in Computer Science, Mathematics, and STEM fields that could benefit from research involving Python and the Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy libraries.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Scientific Computing with Python: High-performance scientific computing with NumPy SciPy and pandas 2nd Edition
"Disclosure: I was invited to write a review for this book based on a pre-print copy. Thoughts below represent my honest evaluation.This book is a great learning resource for Python beginners as well as the experts. Authors of this book have clearly put in great effort to make sure that the book is accessible to a diverse set of audience.Starting from the very basics, the book gradually introduces more advanced concepts. Throughout, the explanations remain clear, concise, and original. For example, I appreciated that instead of using routine examples to introduce object-oriented concepts, authors picked use cases from computational math.The book also gets a high score on the organization and the flow of topics. In particular, all the relevant sections are appropriately cross-referenced. I also loved the summary and exercises section at the end of each chapter.In some cases, the book seems to sacrifice depth over breadth. For example, I was surprised to see the omission of plotly and seaborn package in the chapter on plotting. Content on f-strings and date/time handling in pandas dataframe is also conspicuously missing. It would have been great if authors at least added references to these topics.I also found the narration in the book to be spoon-feeding in nature. Authors could have kept the readers more engaged by adding quizzes through the text.Despite these shortcomings, it's remarkable how much the authors have been able to achieve through this book. It would be my go-to resource both to refresh the fundamentals as well as to learn new things. I highly recommend it to both python/ data science practitioners and enthusiasts.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Scientific Computing with Python: High-performance scientific computing with NumPy SciPy and pandas 2nd Edition
"This is the second and revised edition of the first book from the same author(s). Before I recommend this book, I would like to bring some features of this book that got my attention:This is a complete book for anyone who uses Python for their scientific research work, meaning it covers almost all aspects of scientific computation. It can go alongside other popular C++ or MATLAB scientific computation books and be a great helper for people who want to be more pythonic than MATLABic per se.I like how they have compiled parallel computation with mpi4py and symbolic math computation with sympy. As a scientist with 11+ years of experience, I think these are an essential part of modern scientific computation.Overall, this is a very well-organized book with many exercises and answers in the back. The book is designed for learning and achieves that purpose very well.My recommendation of this book is not only for newbies who are curious about scientific Python but also for those interested in using it seriously in scientific programming and data analysis. It is an excellent introduction to a powerful analytical tool.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Scientific Computing with Python: High-performance scientific computing with NumPy SciPy and pandas 2nd Edition
"(Disclaimer: I received a free evaluation copy from the publisher)The first part of the book (amounting to about 2/3 of the overall material) presents solutions to 14 bioinformatics challenges from the Rosalind.info challenge website, which are representative of key tasks a bioinformatician would typically need to perform in their day to day work, like transforming sequence data in various ways, finding motifs, doing things with enzyme restriction sites etc. I particularly appreciate that the author focuses on explaining the reasoning behind the solutions that are presented. I.e. not just ""this is how you should do it"", but rather ""here's why this is a good way to do it, and here's why you don't want to do it this other way"".The second part (last 1/3) of the book demonstrates how to assemble actual programs involving multiple tasks like parsing text files, doing something useful with the data, and producing appropriately formatted outputs. This is incredibly valuable since the ""solving the puzzle""  part of bioinformatics ultimately means nothing if you can't deploy your solution as a program that's going to be usable by others. In that vein, the book includes a couple of appendices on things like testing, documentation etc that are more about general programming techniques and less bioinformatics-specific, but put in the context of the rest of the book, which I think is a great idea and really rounds it out.Overall the content seems well calibrated for people who already have some experience with command-line work, basic programming concepts in general, and a solid understanding of Python syntax, without requiring formal training in those areas. On the biology side, the author very briefly recaps the relevant concepts to a level that should be sufficient for people with college-level intro biology/genetics under their belt. Anyone with less bio background than that should probably take a refresher course or be prepared to do some active googling.In summary, I expect any bioinformatician in training would likely benefit from reading this book, and every bioinformatics group should get a copy of this for their lab library as a handy reference. It's the type of book you can work through cover to cover if you're there to learn, or just dip in and out of for help with solving specific problems.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering Python for Bioinformatics: How to Write Flexible Documented Tested Python Code for Research Computing

"For any interesting in learning Python, I think this would be a fantastic start. I suspect as with most things, you'll want to pick up additional books to help continue your learning afterwards. This is pretty much with just about any subject, let alone something as complex as programming. The author(s) did a fantastic job on walking through the material in the chapters, and I felt like it was fairly well put together from a personal opinion. As I stated, no one book can cover everything related to any language specifically, but from a starting standpoint, and the method Head First books tend to use, it was certainly a great book to start the learning process.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Head First Python: A Brain-Friendly Guide

"I'm learning Python for my job. My specific application is focused on data science and rote task automation.Before getting this book, I had picked up a copy of ""Automate the Boring Stuff With Python"" and ""Python for Data Analysis"". Both books do a solid job of introducing you to the areas of interest, but neither do a very good job of teaching a novice like myself how to start programming in Python (in my humble opinion). In those two books, I would struggle to get through the end-of-chapter test programs, because they required a lot of information that either wasn't addressed, or wasn't discussed until later in the book.That's where this book comes in. The explanations are intuitive, easy to follow, and the topics are covered in a way that facilitates (successful) user experimentation. Right now, I'm using all three books in tandem and things are starting to click and my code is starting to work with a lot less Googling and a little more tinkering on my part. Head First Python is a pretty quick read because of all of the graphics and generous spacing. Although I tend to prefer a sense of order, the cartoonish-looking page layouts really do aid the learning process. I believe that there is a psychological effect experienced by some people, wherein turning a page imparts a sense of progress. You will certainly turn a lot of pages quickly when reading this book, because of the layouts. This may give some people the fuel to keep going for longer stretches than they would if they were reading 50-page chapters of dense, verbose material.At the end of the day, I highly recommend this book, especially if you want to supplement it with something that pushes you a little more toward a specific application of Python. In my spare time over the last three weeks, I've cleared about 200 pages of each of the 3 books and I've written around 20 or 30 little programs (on top of dozens of hours in the iPython shell). By the end of week 4, I expect to start producing code for some of my medium-scope projects, and I'll continue to build on it as I learn.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Head First Python: A Brain-Friendly Guide
"I've been learning from O'Reilly books for 21 years now, and I've never found anything to complain about in them.  The Head First group of books has over the last few years become on of my favorite series from them.  I've been programming for 24 years.  My first O'Reilly book was the Camel book--the PERL reference, which helped me quickly reach a new level of competency in programming.  My affinity for the Head First books is that they take the usual 101 textbook format and make it fun, interesting, and dialectically unique, in a common format. Down to a science.  The writing, images, diagrams, asides, and everything else makes each book familiar but distinct, and easy to work through as leisure.  I've been programming since I was 17, and most books back then were aimed at college students or professionals.  It's nice to find books I can learn from leisurely, as I want to learn as many languages as I can.

When the 3rd edition comes out, I'd like to see the author teach more of the basics before he has us start installing and using external packages and importing pre-built HTML and cascading style sheets.

"Bought this book as an amazon ebook.  Currently working through the programming exercises.  It is relatively easy to follow and the examples are definitely interesting and fun.  Examples use mostly API python modules for coding.  It is always amazing how little code it can take to create a fully functional application using api components.  The web browser app surprised me and works quite well.  The writer certainly knows his stuff.  The example code can be downloaded to save time but I like to manually enter the code, since you learn by doing.  It also helps you understand error messages and how to fix typos, indent or syntax errors.  I tend to miss colon's and  have learned to watch more carefully when coding.  The only complaint would be that I found the book a little pricey considering it was an ebook.  I feel the publishers (not necessarily Amazon) are gouging the public by over pricing.

For example, it spends a good bit of time explaining basic programming concepts such as syntax and logical constructs. And for most of the chapters it describes what is happening in the code line-for-line.

"Having had this book for about 3 months now, and read most of it, I would say we have had a bit of a 'love - hate' relationship.  The positive points for me are:- The book gathers a great deal of information on 3 major MicroPython hardware platforms in one place - that alone might be sufficient reason to buy it.-  The book is project-oriented, which is often a very good way to learn a subject.  The projects are clearly explained for the most part-  There is a good level of technical depth in that the author often attempts to provide background information and explanations, as opposed to just presenting a project solution.  There are also many code examples that are instructive.My 'problems' with the book are:- The back cover says: ""Program your own .. projects with ease -- no prior programming experience necessary"".  This is marketing nonsense.- The author's writing style is a bit tedious at times.  He has a habit of ending each minor section of the book with ""next I will discuss ..."", and  includes an introduction and summary for each chapter.  Unfortunately, these intros and summaries do not contain any useful information, but just a rehash of what he covered in the chapter.- The book sometimes reads as though a class lecture was recorded and then transcribed and edited into a book.  There are too many ""I's"" and off-handed comments.-  There are places where some readers might well want more information, but the author decides he won't go any further, notably the discussion on WiPy wi-fi modes where he decides not to discuss Direct mode because ""the station and access point ... are all that I need to illustrate networking..."" and the discussion of the basic theory of GPS where he states: ""you need a fourth [GPS] beacon ... I am not going to go through the whole process again as I think you have it figured out by now"".  How would you know?-  In his (laudable) attempt to provide additional interesting information, he sometimes gets it wrong. In the discussion about GPS clock accuracy he introduces and tries to explain time dilation and Special Relativity.  He says that a space traveler moving at the speed of light would make a roundtrip  to Alpha Centauri in about 10 years, while his 'twin' back on earth would age 50 years!  That's just incorrect.  The roundtrip at light speed takes 10 years on earth, but the astronaut experiences a slowing of clocks (and a foreshortening of distance) such that he perceives the trip as taking only 2-3 years (depending on how close to the speed of light he travels).I could go on with other examples.  Many of these problems (especially the writing and stylistic ones) could have been avoided by a more rigorous editing process, so it's unfortunate that they were allowed to pass.One other note (which the author readily acknowledges, to his credit):  these hardware and software platforms are evolving rapidly, and some of the information in the book is already dated and incorrect.  For example, I spent several hours trying to connect to a WiPy as an Access Point, only to discover (after a significant loss of hair), that Pycom had changed the WPA key and the WiPy's IP address!  So it pays to check out these things yourself.So, I'm really somewhere between a 3 and 4 on this book, but with all the information and examples included, and coverage of three hardware platforms all in one place, I give an extra 0.5 for effort!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Microcontrollers: Getting Started with MicroPython
As much as I love Donald Norris's books I have to say this one is not extremely useful. By the time I bought it it was very outdated and all the information can be found online.

"Found it to be the ideal introduction to MicroPython, with great coding examples for a wide variety of projects. Also covers many of the new microcontrollers from Pycom. Although too new to be included in this book, the general code examples will be useful for coding the new OpenMV M7 camera modules that use MicroPython.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Microcontrollers: Getting Started with MicroPython
"Python for Microcontrollers is a small book about running Python on various microcontroller boards. Many hackers will be particularly interested in running Micropython on the ESP8266 because of how cheap various ESP8266 modules are. Sadly, this book's content is not impressive.The most important thing about this book is that it DOES NOT cover the Python language and is NOT a hand-holding tutorial (So much for the ""Getting Started"" in the title).Unfortunately this book has a number of flaws/omissions:- In Chapter 6 there is a section titled ""Playing MP3 Files"" but the code doesn't actually play MP3s, but short (less than 2 seconds!) .WAV files. Where did the ""MP3"" title come from?- The ESP8266 modules covered are NOT the popular and easily available NodeMCU or Wemos D1 Mini modules but the Adafruit Huzzah (which is more expensive than the above modules) and also the bare ESP-12E module. Working with the above modules is much easier than the bare ESP-12E so I'm not sure why this was selected.- In the ESP8266 section (Chapter 9) the author wastes some space talking about the 2.4GHz antenna trace length calculation on the ESP-12E and proving that the antenna is indeed a 2.4GHz antenna. This serves no useful purpose as users really don't care about the antenna once they can program the thing to do what they want.- Chapter 9 mentions that MQTT is a work in progress and there is no coverage but umqtt modules are now built-in to Micropython. MQTT is a very popular and easily implemented communications protocol but you wouldn't find any info in this book.- The mention of WebREPL for the 8266 doesn't make it clear that the benefit is that you are no longer restricted by communicating via USB. The instructions are also out of date (you need to do 'import webrepl_cfg' via USB terminal and setup a password so that you have some security). The book does not have information about the WebREPL password.- ESP8266: doesn't mention I/O sink/source current limits (and voltage levels) for I/O pins. How are you supposed to interface devices (such as driving LEDs) without this data?In a sense the problem with this book is the technical content is out of date - the book was written in Fall 2016 and covers v1.8.2, but the current version at the time of this review is v1.9.2. Not all of the book's problems are the fault of the author, as technical books tend to become irrelevant extremely quickly (especially for evolving projects like Micropython).The other thing about this book is that it is covering too many different boards in such a small book - the Pyboard, ESP8266, and WiPy. I would have settled for only Pyboard and expanded ESP8266 coverage using NodeMCU and Wemos D1 Mini/Pro modules (and ESP32 when it becomes mature)SUMMARY: I would suggest browsing online resources instead of this book if you are not an absolute beginner. If you don't know Python you will have to do this anyway since this does not teach the language. This book attempts to straddle electronics, python, and micropython topics but there is much missing from the book. (To be fair it would take a full size book to cover these, instead of the existing ""mini"" sized book)I hope you have found this review useful!",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Microcontrollers: Getting Started with MicroPython

"I found this book a bit of a disappointment. In the advertising it says ""Learn MicroPython and object-oriented programming basics""  and ""Program Your Own MicroPython projects with ease―no prior programming experience necessary! "" So I assumed it would be a stand alone book allowing me to program one of those MicroPython boards. But in actuality....The author starts off with describing object -orientation.  This covered about four pages and the only reason I understood it was I already have some OO exposure. So I would not agree that this is describing the basics.  The book then moves to a MicroPython example but there is hardly any explanation of what the code means. Since I do not know Python I thought this book would help with that, but i was wrong  - it didn't.Now having said all that I do think the book will be useful for programming  one of the Python microcontrollers  But in my opinion to get best usage out of this book you should already be familiar with OO concepts and Python.Would I still have bought it If i knew all of this in advance? - Yes but only after I had got some more experience with Python",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Microcontrollers: Getting Started with MicroPython
"I was looking for a book that would teach me the syntax and programming structures of micropython. This book has very little information on micropython. The author filled the book with his experiences building a few projects and included some snippets of code that he used to test them.The book starts off with a brief and confusing explanation of some programming concepts. The examples are focused on his robot project but out of context they are just reference material with little value. The author spends a lot of time explaining the specifications and operations of devices that would be better learned from manufacturer data sheets. I tried to use the book to write some simple programs to control leds but even the index is void of guidance on how the author writes programs in micropython. If your are interested in this authors' experience with building a few hobby projects, you may glean some value from the book however, if you are looking to learn micropython, this book is almost worthless.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Microcontrollers: Getting Started with MicroPython
"The author is an acknowledged expert on the Arduino microcontroller and Raspberry Pi SBC ecologies, but is less familiar with MicroPython and the PyBoard. The book is disjointed. It may have been rushed to market by McGraw Hill Education/TAB, and falls short of their other offerings. Some things that stand out: Pages 4 to 21 of Chapter 1 contain a strange digression into Object-Oriented Programming; Chapter 4 presents an unusual 'Let Ball Detector' project; and Chapters 5 and 6 describe hardware that was obsolete when the book was published. The coverage of generic topics such as UART's, the I2C and SPI protocols,GPS module interfacing, and ESP8266 modules is decent.People who want to understand and appreciate the elegance and power of Damien George's implementation of, MicroPython, on the PyBoard or on other platforms, can go to micropython.org to read excellent documentation and visit user forums. They can also read books that have been published more recently by aficionados of MicroPython.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Microcontrollers: Getting Started with MicroPython
"Pros:- It was the only micropython book available when I purchased it, and I like learning from books rather than online tutorials- It presents a few good basic real examples that are enough to get you startedCons:- It's very disjointed and poorly written- While it introduces concepts like I2C and analog to digital converters, it doesn't explain how they work in enough depth to be able to extrapolate well when you hit bugs in your own code.Overall, it explains basic concepts on both microcontrollers and programming in Python in a way targeted at beginners, but doesn't cover either topic sufficiently well for a beginner or an intermediate or an advanced person. I came in knowing Python but not microcontrollers and found it barely sufficient to get an orientiation.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python for Microcontrollers: Getting Started with MicroPython
"Ironically the preface of the book specifically states that this was written for those who did not want to work with online tutorials, yet I have spent many hours online trying to understand the concepts introduced in the so called 1st, so called ""Introduction"" chapter. This chapter covers, object oriented programming, raspberry pi, attempts to design robot logic, classes, dynamic binding, etc. I was lost at by page 12.I think this was written for someone experienced in microprocessors, and not for the beginner. It does not go into very much detail as to how to get started. ""Go buy a Pyboard, hook it up to your terminal program, and download the PDF datasheet from STM"". If that is enough instruction for you, the next step in chapter 2 are interrupts mind you, this may be the book for you.I would return the book, but it does seem to have example programs that may be helpful in the future. The cost of the book is such that I don't feel much of a loss in keeping it. I have the Arduino and Raspberry Pi books from this series, which were a lot better and well worth the cost.

"I already have the print version of this book, and like it a lot. It's full of very instructive examples that you can study and learn from.I bought the Kindle edition in January 2019 wondering if it had a table of contents, as some people said, no, it didn't.First of all, I wouldn't even try to read the Kindle edition on my Kindle Paperwhite, since the screen is too small and the contrast is not great. Instead, I read it on the Kindle for PC Windows program, and the book is easy to read, including the code examples (this is on a 24"" monitor).I can report that when read on the Kindle PC program, the inline text in the main window does not include a text version of the table of contents. However, on the left side of the Kindle PC program, if you click the icon for ""table of contents"", a full clickable and expandable table of contents appears in a narrow window to the left of the main text window. This is fully usable as a table of contents, and makes for very easy browsing. There is also a full clickable index at the end of the main body of text. The page numbers in my Kindle edition correspond exactly with the page numbers in my printed version. Another Kindle for PC plus: the example code uses color for syntax highlighting, which is nice.Edit: Upon further browsing, if you go to the very end of the main text window, there is a clickable text version of the table of contents. It's not so useful at the very end of the document - the left-side table of contents window is much more convenient.

"Python Cookbook goes in depth on a variety of different Python topics. Each section is similar to a question that might be asked on Stack Overflow. The recipes range in difficulty from easy to advanced metaprogramming.One particular recipe that I liked was 9.1 on how to time a function. When I am using Python I often need to time the code, and usually I need to look up how to do it. This example created a decorator function for timing. It makes it so that you can just put @timethis on top of a function and see how long it takes to execute. I appreciated how elegant this solution was as opposed to the way I was implementing it.Most examples are self contained and all the code examples that I tried worked. Additionally, there is a GitHub that the authors created which provides all the code for the examples if you do not want type it yourself. The examples themselves were applied to real world problems; I could see how the recipe was used clearly. When the authors felt they could not provide an entire solution in the text, they point the correct place to visit online.The range in topics was impressive. I found the most challenging chapters to be 9, 12, and 15 which were on metaprogramming, concurrency, and C Extensions. At the beginning of the book the recipes cover topics you would expect like data structures and algorithms, strings, and generators. I found myself surprised that I had not seen a lot of the techniques and solutions before. They were well crafted solutions, and I appreciated how much time and detail the authors must have spent to gather the information.This is a great reference to have by your side when programming in Python.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Cookbook Third Edition
"Honestly, the best book on Python I’ve seen (4 years experience, myself). David Beazley is hands down my favorite “instructor,” and I’m re-purchasing the book because I destroyed my old one from highlighting/writing etc all over it.What’s great are the little explanations of specific stuff and the details that provide a great background-info (like when you’d want to specifically use type.__init__ and not type.__new__ in a metaclass,), and will give full examples, even to a “ridiculous” end to show how it can be done (ie super complicated single meta programming call vs piecemeal with decorators), but since it does the same thing it helps to illustrate that there’s usually an alternative way to do a very specific thing if you need it.P.S. check out the authors webpage as he has pdf and slides of great info/resources. It’s just as useful (Though not as broad) as the book.P.P.S. if you’re looking at other books, I don’t recommend the “essential python reference.” You’d be just as good with the general docs.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Cookbook Third Edition
"The Active State repository of Python recipes includes many gems, but as the Authors observe in their preference: ""most of these recipes are steeped in history and the past"".  I'd add that the signal to noise ratio seems to be decreasing.  The most prolific contributors (with the exception of Raymond Hettinger) have posted trivial examples rather than recipes.  This book includes some simple examples too, but it's always in the context of a larger message.  Excellent content and advice without the chaff.I just bought this today.  Unlike some early technical Kindle books I've purchased, the formatting is excellent.  Kudos to the authors and publisher.  But when I first browsed the content with Kindle-Android on my 7"" tablet (Nexus), I still found it frustrating to read.  Next, I tried my laptop with a 14"" screen - better.  And then tried it on my PC with a large monitor and found reading and jumping around the content much more productive and pleasurable.  Switched back to the tablet, I changed the text settings to minimums for font size, margin size, line spacing and entered full-screen mode.  Result: much better!  That said, I still found the much larger screen area on my PC monitor preferable.Bottom Line: Buy this for great Python 3.3 code and advice in a flexible format.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Cookbook Third Edition
"Having read some humdrum works in the Cookbook series, my expectations were not very high. However, I soon discovered that this book is in a different league.When he discusses a problem, Beazley gives you his favorite solution. He also presents alternatives, discusses pros and cons, and calls your attention to subtle details in the solution --- leaving you with a feeling of having learned something of value.But that's only the beginning. It's hard to describe the pleasure of reading some of the solutions in the Iterators and Generators section, for instance. Actually, I take that back. The pleasure is the same kind as what you may have felt when you first came upon ideas in books such as Bentley's Programming Pearls, way back when.I hadn't felt that excited about a programming book in a long time. This is one you can take along with you on a weekend just for the pleasure of sipping from it. Sad to say, but there are many O'Reilly books I feel like passing on soon after acquiring them. This one will have a special place on the shelves.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Cookbook Third Edition
"Beazley has a 'deeply clueful' understanding of Python.  What you see in this book is not just how to get things done, but how to do it in the 'Pythonic' fashion.  It shows you how to work with the language, not just implementing it with generic 'this will work in any language' constructs.This book has showed me how to do a lot of new things, and even if I already knew how to do something, now I know how to do it better, faster, cleaner, or more robustly.The book is also well written.  Finding the material, and reading through the narratives for particular snippets of code is very clear, there's rarely a need to go back to re-read anything, ideas are conveyed simply but effectively.I own a bunch of other Python books, but they all have a time and place in your learning process.

I'll be using this in the future since I should have known this as it's the same with the Perl Cookbook... but hey.For now it's nice to reference so I don't learn from the bottom up.

"This is certainly not for beginners, but it is an extremely handy reference for how to do most tasks of various levels of madness in python. The discussions are brief, but thorough enough to give you a solid grasp on the particular snippet of code. It's also great for showing pythonic ways of utilizing the tools at hand. It does not motivate these tasks, you need to know what you're looking for, but even a brief read-through can shine light on things you never thought were possible in the standard library.5 stars for those wanting to understand the under-the-hood mechanics of python as well as mad-scientists testing their limits. 2-stars for beginners, as the first few chapters might be useful, but will largely go over the heads of those just getting started.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Cookbook Third Edition
"Overall a worthwhile addition to my Python library.  I thought at first that the coverage levels were uneven - some of the data structures discussion could easily be grasped by a beginner but the Class recipes were very deficit to comprehend.  That may be more indicative of indicating where I'm not up to speed in my Python than anything to do with the writing.  The text by itself is pleasant and non-academic with clear explanations.  There is, admittedly, a lot in the book that is currently well beyond my understanding (I'm a retired programmer but never worked in most of the areas covered), so the book additionally has provided a challenge to learn from someone who obviously knows what they're doing.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Cookbook Third Edition

Each one of the concepts that this book teaches had a lot of work and effort put into by the authors. Wether it's the text or the code examples, the quality is high. The book is written in a way that you can read it in a linear fashion but it can also serve as a reference once you know where everything is. The authors of this book are very talented and experienced python developers with background in data science. In addition to showing many advanced methods for making your code fast, they put a strong emphasis on when/where to use each method and the importance of profiling and benchmarking.This book is probably a better read for people with an intermediate understanding of Python, operating systems and parallel programming.

Nice book,4.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Math with Python: Use Programming to Explore Algebra Statistics Calculus and More!
"This book is best used by high school students as an adjunct to their math, statistics, and physics courses. It could also be used by other learners particularly self learners. The excercises are well thought out and the answers with code are downloadable. This is a wonderful feature, however,  there will always  be the risk that  learners may be tempted  to download the code before they try to write it themselves. It is nice to see the code for calculating mean, median, mode, and variance without just using Excel or SPSS and plugging your data in. The excercises in chapter 3 allow these statistical functions to be placed in a module which can be called subsequently. I would strongly recommend using Anaconda as it has the matplotlib and sympy modules  easily called. I encountered major error codes when I tried using Pycharm with Python 3.9.  These appear to be path errors which I was not able to fix. I was able to use Pycharm if I used Anaconda running with Python 3.8. The author has listed several errata which can be found through the publisher's website. Overall I have been enjoying the book. I remember  in high school having to do the calculations by hand demonstrating Newton's law and the graphics of throwing projectiles. The scientific calculators were not available until my first year of college in 1972. I am only disappointed that more time is not spent on trigonometric functions and Fourier analysis. More time should also be spent on complex variables and Euler's function. All high school students contemplating engineering and physics majors in college would appreciate this. The appendix documenting installing Anaconda needs to be updated and the errata fixed in the next edition. Making the solutions and code for the excercises is wonderful. The author deserves our thanks for a nice publication.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Math with Python: Use Programming to Explore Algebra Statistics Calculus and More!
"I don't always give 5 stars, but when I do, it's for real. Stay coding my friends! Actually, I'm only about half way through the book, but I felt I had to do the review now. After dumping MicroShaft and getting into Linux, I could no longer use VisualBASIC; I had to choose another language and it came down to ""C"" or Python. I chose Python because I wanted to do some real work without trudging through a 3 year learning curve. Python is, as they say, easy to pick up, especially if you have prior coding experience.You should know the basic Python syntax and structure, basic commands etc., before starting this book; it isn't a ""beginners 1st Python"" book. But one or two of the ""24 hour"" or ""1 day"" starter books will be sufficient. Also, this book is intended for people who want to get into serious math and graphics. If you are into science, engineering, etc., this is for you.VERY well written and laid out; also, it isn't a big scary 600 page monster that might be intimidating to pick up and start - it's only 200 pages and there is no wasted space. A lot is said in minimal volume (I always like that). You will continue to learn Python as you proceed; also you will learn about math, graphics, and some physics as well. Most important - you will see how you can use Python to solve real world math problems and apply this to whatever you are doing.It starts out simple with basic math functions, then rapidly progresses to graphing equations, then statistics; later on complex graphics (fractals - my thing), and calculus. Right now this is brain workout and fun for me, but I hope to use it later for work. The book is very easy to follow as you move along. You should use an interactive python editor (like Idle3) rather than try to run from the command line, although you can do that if you want.One thing you can do is copy all the code snippets [after understanding them <g> and perhaps modifying a little] and collect them all in a personal python module which you can then use forever. Also, as you run the code snippets and play with them as you proceed through the book, you can experiment and modify / run them on the spot – this is a good way to learn – to stamp it into your brain in a way you will remember.Fairly early in the book is a function which calculates and then graphically plots the trajectory of a thrown baseball; the technique is the same for any projectile. I was able to modify it a bit, put it in a loop, and graph the trajectory(s) for an object thrown at all angles from 0->90*. I was thus able to “prove” graphically something that is already well known – all other factors equal, a projectile will travel farthest when launched up at a 45* angle. Cool!If you are in a science or engineering field and want to learn Python for that - I can't over-recommend this book!Cheers.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Math with Python: Use Programming to Explore Algebra Statistics Calculus and More!

"This book would be great, except, it requires that you have software called Anaconda.  That was not immediately evident to me reading the book’s description.  I thought all you needed was Python.Anaconda is free, and would probably be easy enough to load on a full size machine.  It’s a problem, however, for a Raspberry Pi.I had purchased this book with the idea of having fun programming my Raspberry Pi.  That worked until Chapter 2, where programs then called Anaconda functions.I hate to give this book a 1 star, but I want to get anyone’s attention who might be under the same misimpression I was.  The book should have been called, “Doing Math with Python using Anaconda”.  And on the back of the book, it should have stated it was for desktop machines.Clearly what I need is a book called, “Doing Math with Python using GnuPlot on a Raspberry Pi”.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Math with Python: Use Programming to Explore Algebra Statistics Calculus and More!
"As the author states in the second paragraph of the Preface you *do* need to know Python (but not be an expert) before you will get much use from this book.  If you know Python and you have some experience in embedded systems this book will explain all the details like using MicroPython to declare and configure digital and analog I/O pins, pin direction, pull-up and pull-down resistors, and using MicroPython to configure, read and write to sensors or other devices using I2C, SPI, etc.I think it's probably accurate to say that this book focuses on the parts of Python that are specific to embedded systems and that won't be found anywhere else. It covers a lot of different areas using several different devices, unlike some other MicroPython books that use a MicroPython device from a single manufacturer in all the examples. I have several MicroPython books and this is probably my favorite.I would have given it 5 stars but the price is just too high for a technical book that will very likely be outdated in a year or so.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Programming with MicroPython: Embedded Programming with Microcontrollers and Python

"Overall I was disappointed in this book.  I found it lacking in technical depth, with a great deal of text spent on exposition and detailing the virtues of microcontrollers and IoT.  While a nod is given to a few other Micropython microcontrollers, the vast majority of the focus is on the micro:bit, with little assistance provided in porting code between devices.  I would expect a book like this to cover what Micropython modules are available for each device, the functions available in those modules, and the differences between them.. none of that was included.  The book spends very little time actually discussing Micropython, despite using it for every example.  Very little attention is given to the ESP8266/ESP32, though a few examples are present for it.  Some neat examples are presented for the micro:bit and Circuit Playground boards.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Programming with MicroPython: Embedded Programming with Microcontrollers and Python
Just started the book yesterday.  Really enjoying it.  Well-written.  Thanks Nicholas.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Programming with MicroPython: Embedded Programming with Microcontrollers and Python
"This isn't a book about HOW to program embedded systems in MicroPython, but ABOUT using MicroPython in embedded systems.There is a big difference between the two.If you already are adept at programming in Python you will find this an interesting take on how you can carry your existing skills over to micro-controllers and the domain of embedded programming. You will find the pages detailing development board options insightful, and appreciate the examples of using sensors and outputs. You will find the sections like ""Abilities of Enchantment"" and ""The Zen of MicroPython"" an interesting view on philosophical approaches to the language and embedded development.If you can already write programs but are not familiar with the Python language, studying the examples will get you going but will provide minimal insight into the language's structure, features and usage. Key concepts like the language's syntax, variables, dictionaries and lists do not even get an entry in the book's index, and if they are mentioned it is only in passing. This was my situation, and I quickly decided to go to other material to learn the basics of the language.It is stated explicitly in the footnote on the bottom of page IX, and I agree. To get value from this book you need to be familiar with Python's syntax, how do define and call a function and how to control program flow in your code. If you do not already know the Python language, or are new to the fundamentals of programming then you are going to find this book very challenging.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Programming with MicroPython: Embedded Programming with Microcontrollers and Python
"Another “micropython” book that soends half of the book explaining how to install micropython on all the things. I’m so irritated once I got to the part in the book where the author went on a multi paragraph lecture on celebrating difference and diversity, excercising capacity for empathy, adapting to change, etc(NOT A JOKE) the title of the book is misleading and now I have to read his horrible attempt to work in all the cultural buzzwords into a PROGRAMMING book! If your expecting a well written programming book like I was from O’Reilly, your going to be seriously disappointed. Tip to the Author. No one is using the Microbit! It’s old and outdated. They decided to stand still while the microcontroller revolution blew by. For a fraction of the price you can buy a board with WiFi and Bluetooth and for some reason felt the need to focus on the microbit. So disappointed O’Reilly put their name on this. Hopefully they’ll get back on track after this blunder. One more thing, most programming books are 350-600+ pages and still gloss over a lot of information.

I found the topics in this book to be fascinating which is why I picked it up and was hopeful that a self taught developer would be able to find some use for this book. To which I have found some nuggets of helpful tips. It broke down bit shifting in a pretty digestible manner.However with all the above said I found the book very disorganized. For example in chapter one the purpose was on the discussion about small problems. We go straight into the fibonacci sequence (which did give some very helpful hints on recursion) but then right after talking about that we go straight into memoization without any segue. Then after that we go right into trivial compression then after 4 to 4 1/2 pages we go right into unbreakable encryption. With each change in topic I was left with trying to figure out what the author wanted me to gain and how did those specifically classify as small problems.I gave it a 3 because this book does have some very cool insights and taking the examples and making them my own has helped but for someone without a CS degree I was left wanting more depth and that is something that I didn't get.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Classic Computer Science Problems in Python

"I particularly like the way Professor Kopec organized the topics, code and explanations.  Although the book lacks complexity analysis, it is an excellent book for someone who is picking up Python and reviewing CS topics at the same time.  The topics selected by Professor Kopec aren't the same as those you would find in a (rather boring, I should say) data structure and algorithm book where C/Java code snippets are (sometimes in brute force) translated to Python code snippets.  The topics in this book build up a repertoire of re-usable frameworks for the ""basics"" such as search, CSP,  and graph algorithms as an illustration of how generic framework can be constructed in Python to solve classes of similar problems.  In later half of the book Professor Kopec leads the reader into the AI realm of things (at the introductory level) such as neural networks and game theory.  Very enjoyable read and great learning.

"First, I bought this book (and paid the full price) from a local bookstore.  Also, I have not finished the entire book yet, but so far I am having a lot of fun learning.If you don't have any computer or network experience, the learning curve on this subject will be amazingly steep.  It starts with relatively simple concepts but jumps quickly into the heart of networking.  Anyone can follow along, but understanding it well enough to know what or why could be difficult.  The title of the book might be enough to tell you that.  The hands on examples given may not work on all systems and you may have to make some changes.  Experience with IT concepts will help you stay on track.  For example, not all ISP provided equipment works the same and you may need to make changes to your home network, or you may run into issues with outdated libraries in Linux preventing a Python script from running.  Knowing what to do will save you a lot of time.If you have some background in IT, like Help Desk or network engineering experience, this will be a fun journey into Ethical Hacking.

I have over 10 years experience with Python, HTML, Javascript, and CSS, but I knew very little about Flask or server-side Python programming.

It provided just the information I needed when I needed it. The examples were robust enough that I was able to understand the reasoning behind them, and adapt them to my own needs.The linked github repository was also very helpful in clarifying the rare example that needed more information. This was particularly helpful for chapter 7, where the author talks about structuring a more complex application with blueprints and application factories.If I have one minor quibble, its that the requirements.txt file in the github is assumes an older version of Python 3. So it installs older versions of the libraries that don't work with the current version of python (At time of writing 3.10.x ). Kinda annoying to deal with if you want to see the included code run.

"While this isn't at absolute introductory level - I'd recommend getting comfortable using the ""requests"" library to explore existing REST APIs before building your own, and this does require the kind of Python knowledge you would get out of Mark Lutz - this covers ALL the topics you need to build your first API. It is a bit frontend-focused for me, but that's okay, frontend may be your cup of tea after all. Yes, you will need to continue to grow after this book, it should point you to the subjects you need deeper background on, though it is light on references. There are now frameworks like FastAPI giving Flask a run for its money, but it's a battle-hardened framework, and simplifies many concepts for beginner web developers. Excellent. Probably all Python developers who feel that the Flask tutorial moves a bit too quick and is light on explanation should give it a look. If you're a seasoned web developer already, why are you reading or reviewing this? Just read the docs, and then move onto the Elixir ecosystem like the programming guru you already are. If you're starting out, then give this a look, and learn from your colleagues as much as you can.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Flask Web Development: Developing Web Applications with Python
"This is one of the best technical books I have read. I particularly like the use of the git client to align the code for proper execution after the author reaches certain milestones. Of course, when the code fails we often ask, ""what did I miss?"". The git client takes away a lot of the guess work associated with the structure of a project. It also allows you to do a quick refresher of the material after you read it, and the freedom to choose between seeing the project from a birds eye view, or to drill down and write the code directly, if that feels more useful to you.It is important to see the code received by the client web page, as a result of what the server is doing is doing, when translating python code to HTML and javascript. It's easy enough for me to expose the language on the browser, and maybe the author could emphasize how important this is to ""round out"" the learning, but I believe this could be expected; understanding that the typical student will be at the next level when researching server side technologies.There is an online errata for the book, although the errors found during the reading were small enough and can be corrected by the student. This does not veer my interest away, as troubleshooting code should also developed as an important ability for  the student. When I do find a serious error in a book, one that goes beyond being counter-intuitive, I expect the next paragraph to say that this error was expected, and to show me how to fix it. This is great in a book that attempts to save time on typical errors that are made, particularly those errors that could be difficult to solve. It's only when I don't find an error explanation and it takes me a considerable time to troubleshoot, or when I get stuck, that I get concerned about a reading. But this has not been my experience with this book. Errors are minimal, simple, and easy to manage and learn from.This book has exceded by expectations and has made me a fan of the author. I will surely follow him on other writings and projects related to web technologies.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Flask Web Development: Developing Web Applications with Python
"OMG, I gush!  This is just amazing!  Where to begin?First, Miguel has a casual but very clear writing style that made me, as a reader, feel like, ""you got this"".Next, he *knows his stuff*.  He does not just teach flask, but also touches upon all the things that you will need to know in order to create a web server serving a flask app.He had the most ingenious way to structure the book:  he opens with some introduction of the basics of Flask, and once enough is understood, he teaches all the new concepts via an actual app that you can make along with him.  What makes this especially useful/amazing/helpful is the subject matter itself: Flask is a fairly minimal web framework, so lots of plugins and additional tools are needed, so you get to see all the other stuff he pulls in that is necessary, but not strictly Flask.He has the *absolute best GitHub repo* associated with the book.  Lots of folks make GitHub repos for their books; I always think this is a good thing.  But with Miguel, he went ahead and created commits and tags *associated with each part of the book*!!!  You don't understand how awesome this is until you start using it.  You're making an entire app, a fairly big project.  If you just looked at all the code at once, it could be daunting.  If he didn't supply tags, it would be hard to know where to go.  But instead, he'll have *in the textbook* a comment like ""checkout tag 7b"" (the second tag in the 7th chapter).  If you check out this tag in your Git repo, your code will look exactly like his.Lastly, he covers a good deal of unit testing, including covering Selenium, if I remember right.  (I don't have the book right in front of me now.)I *never* choose a technical book by author, and instead by topic.  But I think Miguel Grinberg might have just changed my mind...

"After reading ""Head First Python"", I became interested in developing more Flask-based websites rather then Bootstrap 4 to incorporate more than simple static HTML/CSS.  I needed a back-end SQL database and Flask looked like a good fit to handle both.Miguel Grinberg's book introduced me to Github and SQLAlchemy.  His coverage of the Flask application structure elements were very detailed.  He definitely knows his 'stuff'.I went thru Chapters 1-8 and then kinda lost interest when the material became a bit too low-level for a business application developer.  It was presented very well, but the material began to look more like systems programming than business applications with a nice user experience.The Blog Project looked like a lot of work for a simple user experience and I skipped over it.  If I was building a Wordpress application, I would simply add a plug-in rather than spend a lot of time on an app that wasn't the core attraction of my application.Chapters 14-18 provide a lot of useful guidelines for deployment and performance tuning.This is very good book for an intermediate or advanced developer wanting to learn the full power of Flask from an expert.

"I bought this book to go along with a Flask/SQL video course I'm taking so I can deploy some machine learning projects I've written. I'm not a professional programmer, but I'm not a neophyte either. The topics covered in this book are not particularly difficult at all, but the writing is so abstruse I have to read sentences 4 and 5 times before I can figure out what they mean. Here's an example: ""Imagine having to build the HTML code for a large table by concatenating data obtained from the database with the necessary HTML string literals."" That's not from the middle of a chapter where we've been discussing HTML terminology, but from the introduction to an early flask chapter. What's more, once I looked a couple of things up and was able to decipher the sentence it turned out not to be particularly germain to the topic of the chapter. The book is rife with writing like that: a lot of verbiage that communicates little and does so unclearly.Also, the code renders horribly in the kindle version.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Flask Web Development: Developing Web Applications with Python

"This was the textbook for a condensed online class I took recently. I was eager to learn Python for ArcGIS Pro and found this book very helpful overall, with a couple minor complaints. I had minimal experience with Python previously, just some very basic stuff I learned on my own during my first attempt at learning it. Had never used it with any ArcGIS products. The book actually helped flesh out my lectures and were probably more helpful than my lectures since I could take my time going through it very carefully. I'm planning on buying the advanced scripting for Pro book by the same author.Two things that could make this book even more helpful:1) Exercises at the end of each chapter that walk you through some of this stuff on your own with data provided by the manufacturer's website. I'm surprised that wasn't available here. For coding especially, reading through the text is one thing but actually doing an entire exercise on your own really helps the material stick. Hopefully that is in future editions.2) The book is mostly in paragraph form and there were a lot of instances when it would have been helpful to have concepts broken down in an outline or list format. That's just a personal preference for learning for me but with so much new material for a newbie, I think that would go a long way here. For example, listing out the methods or functions available for a module. I often had to sift through and reread the chapters and highlight areas that helped me hone in on this stuff. Even an appendix at the end would be helpful. The ArcGIS Pro help documentation online has this but having it available in the book while reading through the concepts would be nice.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python Scripting for ArcGIS Pro

"My hosting provider, and my own servers, have py, but that doesn't mean you have access to the libraries mentioned in this fine little book! It attempts to be both an introduction to Python and an intro to some sploits and some forensics. It does a good job if you're into either, and just now starting to learn some of your own Python coding.The ""hot book"" on Python Forensics right now is Hosmer-- 
Python Forensics: A workbench for inventing and sharing digital forensic technology
-- much more detailed, more expensive, more recent, and a much tighter focus on forensics than the broader brush of this book, which includes some pen development. Elesevier always gives their text web resources in the format elsevierdirect dot com forward slash companion then the isbn. This book's code is not as error filled as some earlier reviews said, so I'm guessing that it has been updated and corrected. Again, you'll need library access, and the code isn't as well annotated as Hosmer or Ligh's fine and classic 
Malware Analyst's Cookbook and DVD: Tools and Techniques for Fighting Malicious Code
, but remember it is pure Python, which will help both introduce and fill in some blanks in both Ligh and Hosmer.By the way, Ligh also has a new, wonderful book out on forensics: 
The Art of Memory Forensics: Detecting Malware and Threats in Windows, Linux, and Mac Memory
, and of course Ligh uses Python in all his books, blogs and articles as the ""behind the scenes"" create your own resource. I'm also a developer and contribute to zsand dot com's sandboxes, and one thing this book is missing that you'll find in both Ligh and Hosmer, are COMBINATIONS of sploit software that let you customize or see things like little python windows adding elements to the bigger API. An example would be embedding any PE (dll/exe etc.) in a ""harmless"" looking extension like .pdf, a network update or even a non-kernel/root looking extension like a screen tip or update.Speaking of, since the authors of this book are all military, the upside is seeing how that world thinks (worked in it for some years), but the downside is their ""courtesy."" For example, they will say that the problem with a Google sploit is that it ""requires a developer id which compromises anonymity"" but completely ignores how easy it is to buy, hack, borrow or get those credentials, ids and codes anonymously online. This doesn't have to be black, it can even be for your own honeypot or a follow up on an attack where you don't want your developer id revealed even if you do have you own!Highly recommended for beginners and those with access to py libraries. The caveat is that the freeware and GNU libraries out there are not enough, although they are much better than they were when this text was written, and Hosmer also shows you how to go direct instead of relying on libraries when you can't get them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers Forensic Analysts Penetration Testers and Security Engineers
"A lot of security folks have little to no development experience, complicating their jobs when they want to do something that's slightly different from what existing tools can do. Python provides a particularly useful tool for them because of its innate readability, support for multiple programming paradigms, and tremendous library of existing modules that can be adapted and connected to do new and interesting things. And for those of us with more extensive programming backgrounds in addition to our security skillsets, Python provides an excellent workbench for nearly any relevant task.Violent Python does not pretend in any way to teach readers how to program. In fact, when kicking off the brief section introducing the language itself, it flat out refers to to the reader ""as an experienced programmer"" (p. 6). However, a motivated hacker with limited exposure to Python can still follow along and pick things up relatively quickly, as VP doesn't really use any particularly esoteric language features.That said, it also does not necessarily require the reader to cover it linearly from page 1 to the end. The subtitle of the book, after all, calls it a ""cookbook for hackers"", and it handles its end of the bargain. VP does not go into great detail for these projects but illustrates how to accomplish them relatively simply, primarily as inspiration for the reader who can then use the ideas and code as building blocks for self-driven projects.I rarely like getting technology books in electronic format, and so I have the paperback copy. Given the complete lack of diagrams in this book, however, it wouldn't matter as much in this case. The quality of the paper and printing seems relatively high; the papers have a smooth, creamy texture, and the book has wide margins that lend themselves very well to note taking and similar marginalia. While I'm not particularly a fan of the particular typeface used for code in the book, I didn't find it so distracting as to make it impossible to work. As has become sadly common these days, the book contains a number of typographical errors and I really wish the publisher had put it through one more review iteration to catch them.ContentsChapter 2, ""Penetration Testing with Python"", provides examples of how to perform a port scan (first using the socket API and then with nmap integration), brute forcing, using weaknesses in SSH key generation, injecting malicious IFRAMEs, interacting with Metasploit, and sending custom buffer overflow code over the network.Chapter 3, ""Forensic Investigations with Python"", discusses analyzing the history of wireless access points in the Windows registry (including geolocation), investigation of the Recycle Bin, examining metadata in various document types, and using application artifacts like SQLite databases in Firefox and Skype or iTunes Mobile.Chapter 4, ""Network Traffic Analysis with Python"", gets into better geolocation, packet parsing using dpkt and Scapy, KML generation, and analyzing various types of traffic like the LOIC DDOS tool, varying TTLs from spoofed port scans, and DNS fast-flux, and TCP sequence prediction. It also briefly covers generating packets to match IDS signatures.Chapter 5, ""Wireless Mayhem with Python"", reviews mining WiFi traffic for personal information like payment cards and authentication credentials, analyzing 802.11 probes and beacons, intercepting and hijacking UAV command traffic, detecting Firesheep use, and manipulate Bluetooth networks.Chapter 6, ""Web Recon with Python"", explains the Mechanize and BeautifulSoup libraries as well as using the Google and Twitter APIs, plus a small section on spear phishing.Chapter 7, ""Antivirus Evasion with Python"", covers how to use Pyinstaller to obfuscate a Metasploit payload from antivirus as well as how to check your code automatically against AV scanners.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers Forensic Analysts Penetration Testers and Security Engineers
"I have an avid interest in cyber security, and I've been interested in python for some time, but I never bothered to learn python because I didn't have a use case for it.  This book piqued my interest, and I believe it was worth while.Violent Python covers python and pen testing on a beginner's level.  The concepts presented are relevant, though most of the specific examples are inefficient, or more commonly, obsolete--and this appears to be deliberate.  This should not discourage one from using this book as an introductory learning tool.While learning programming or any branch of computer security, you will run across a lot of books in which no more than a few chapters will be useful (especially true for programming titles).  This is the norm.  You will take those useful chapters to heart as you learn, and eventually you will run across a book or two that will incorporate your piece-meal knowledge, connecting the dots into something more concrete.  This is just the process of knowledge evolution.  Books on these topics are more commonly a guided tour with some freedom to roam on your own.  Every enthusiastic professional has redundant volumes on their given area of interest/expertise.I will say that the jump into threading (as implemented in python) at the end of the first chapter had me put the book down for a week while I wrangled (and often mangled) other threading examples online so I could discern best and poor practice as I continued this book.I think the intention of this book was to provide proof of concepts and engage the reader into exploring both python and security on their own.  I do not see anywhere in this book even an inclination of intention to present any topic on the whole.In short, if you're not a beginner in python, there are other books that will teach security better.  If you are a beginner to python, regardless of your level of security expertise, this book will prove useful as a python learning tool.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers Forensic Analysts Penetration Testers and Security Engineers
"Took a quick flick through to get an idea of the content and went back to cover the parts I am interested in.Although the book does cover some Python basics very well and steps through the install of both Python and packages used throughout the book, explaining why and where each one is needed I am not sure I would recommend the book to beginners and I do not think that is the target audience. If however you understand some programming basics and want to get into writing your own tools in Python this book will give you some of the most concise and well documented examples I have seen. Providing not just instructions on what you need to do but (more importantly) why you would want to do it. It provides the base scripts and the understanding leaving it up to the reader to take the script and expand on it as needed, an approach I like.The writing style is clear and easy to follow, I am working my way back through the sections on packet capture using the nmap libraries getting a lot of info as I go along.

"This review is based on the Kindle edition of the book. I have not seen the print edition.  This book, while not intended as a text for learning Python programming, is a good companion to a basic but academic text book.  I found the examples given in this book a good introduction to what is possible in the real world with Python and many useful third-party libraries:  wireless and wired network sniffing and packet crafting, Bluetooth device detection, IP address geolocation and much more.  I only wish that more care had been taken in the editing, especially of the code samples.  For a language so sensitive to indentation like Python, it should be clear where lines begin, but it is not.  I sometimes found myself having to refer to the code downloaded from the companion web site.  Some of the code in the book was obviously cut and pasted from other, similar, programs earlier in the book without changing the variable names--these programs won't work if typed in directly from the book.  A good technical editor should have caught that.  A bit more detail on setting up the environment and installing some of the third-party libraries would have been useful, as some of them require a C/C++ compiler as well.  Despite these caveats, I enjoyed this book and learned a great deal from it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers Forensic Analysts Penetration Testers and Security Engineers
"While this book has taught me a lot and given me ideas for future projects in Python, one major downfall is the ridiculous number of typos. It would be okay if there were only typos in the text itself, but even the code snippets have typos, rendering some programs unusable. I have managed to, with logic and trial and error, correct some mistakes in the code chunks for my own projects, but this is only because I have a more than basic understanding of Python.With that being said, this book does provide some amazingly useful insight into what can be done with simple Python scripts with regard to computer and network security. I've learned a lot from the history this book covers, as well as concepts which will come in handy for other applications besides computer security. This book takes an idea and builds on it over a chapter, and starts again at the beginning of each chapter, providing an in-depth understanding in multiple aspects of computer security and how Python's role.I would NOT recommend this book to anyone with a beginner understanding of Python, but only to those who wish to further their knowledge of the practical uses of Python in computer security.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers Forensic Analysts Penetration Testers and Security Engineers
"I have wanted to play around with the Python scripting language for a while, but life is busy and I never really got the opportunity. Then Violent Python showed up on my ""to read"" list. So I opened it and there were coding examples very early in the book. The author talks about creating a development environment and that is probably a good idea, but I work on a Mac, and hoped things would just work. So when we got to page 21, Your First Program, I just brought up a terminal window and typed in what it said on the page. It worked! That got me excited and I went back through the first chapter where the author introduces the language. I do not know that I will ever be a great Python scripter, but it is fun to know the basics. I spent the next four days playing with some of the examples. I could not do all the examples, for instance the Windows Registry, but I found the networking stuff to be fascinating. I do not personally aspire to become a penetration tester, but for anyone that does, I am confident this is an excellent resource.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers Forensic Analysts Penetration Testers and Security Engineers
"TL;DR - go directly to the conclusion.This book is really weird. It shows since the beginning its nature, as stated by the book itself: a cookbook. A set of recipes to do something effectively, one would expect. It is, instead, a series of examples of how replicating some pretty old attack in a pretty bad manner. The reasons why I say this?- the code is bad:  - it looks like ""the Python antipattern cookbook"", that is ""how not to code in Python"" (too long list of examples here, but some: exception handling generally absent and when present it's a ""catch-all"", namespace pollution, old-style classes)  - it completely ignores best practices, code reuse, multithreading, isolation, synchronization, good design- the attacks are very old:  - everything you learn in this book is pointless nowadays- the rationale and explanations are generally absent:  - it doesn't explain why something is done in that way: it just goes ""we do this, and this, and this, et voilà!"". The consequence is that it's useless for a beginner since he can't learn anything new, and it's useless for an expert, since it's too basic to be useful  - there's no troubleshooting at all: what if something doesn't work out of the box? Users reported non-working scripts from the book  - it doesn't explain why we're choosing a library instead of another, a single statement ""it's faster"", ""it's more reliable"", ""I like it"" is better than nothing  - it doesn't explain how those libraries work, what can be really done, how to exploit their potential for our use  - every example is self-contained and can't be easily reused: it doesn't help building an arsenal  - it does poor use of the plethora of Python-based security tools out there  - attacks are not optimized for parallelism: the Python has the GIL, that renders pretty useless the threading module. But also, it has the multiprocessing approach that can circumvent this problem. Unfortunately the author never uses or mention itSomeone may say that ""security people"" shouldn't waste time with programming practices, but that's wrong. Security researchers have always been good programmers by need, and still are. If the code is bad and the attacks are less than practical, what's the point?On the other hand, a good point: the Forensics Investigation chapter is pretty good. Also, if I understood correctly, it has been written by a different contributing author.== Conclusion:I wouldn't buy it again, and, no, I am not happy of the money I spent.

"I’ve been jumping around a bit, but so far, I would have rather spent my money elsewhere. I hate to say this as this book came recommended by some folks I would trust over my rando Google searches. Unfortunately, being written in 2012 for Python 2… We’re just around the corner from Python 4, and 3.9 supported until 2025. So much of this book doesn’t work out of the gate and after grabbing example files from GitHub (not by author), I have to say, I was a bit surprised when I discovered that not only was the code different, it also included A METRIC TON of code that wasn’t even remotely mentioned in the book. Admittedly, I’m a n00b, but for how out of touch with today’s Python this book is, I would look at it more like a book of PoCs more than anything. Nothing more, nothing less. It points you in the direction of “what could work” but you’ll have to do a ton of work to get anything out of it. My recommendation, as blush as it is, pass on this. You can Google more recent examples and not spend as much time pounding your head on the desk trying to get anything to work without a seemingly endless amount of errors.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers Forensic Analysts Penetration Testers and Security Engineers

"I'm fairly new to Python.  I bought this book to learn data visualization techniques with Python.  It's well laid out with step by step instructions and explanations.  There were a few sections that I couldn't get to work (Bokeh and Altair) but for the most part everything works and is correct.  The Bokeh and Altair examples don't work for me but I suspect it's something to do with my setup (versions).  I tried the author's downloaded code with the same result in case I had some weird syntax problem that I wasn't able to figure out.  The other issue is more a problem with the Kindle version of the book.  Depending on where it splits the page, it can make indentations hard to spot.  But that's not really the fault of the author.  Just something to be aware of.Using the techniques in the book, I was able to take some US COVID data and plot out maps with different visualizations (infections by county, infections per capita by county, time series tracking of growth by county).  It was pretty cool to see it match up  the professional sites.  I did a per capita plot that showed a huge bubble in Tennessee, which I thought might have been a defect in the data.

Remember it longer.Edition number: (1)Media type: ebookCopy type: KindleISBN number(s): 1974431479 9781974431472My reviewTo what extent did I read and/or study this book?I read the entire book and completed nearly all of the practice exercises; however, I didn’t look at any of the appendices (because I don’t need to).What fields, subjects, and topics does this book cover?It covers most of the essential functions and methods of the Python (3) computer language.What fields, subjects, and topics does this book NOT cover?This ebook does NOT include any:• programming theory (even absolute-beginner theory)• in-depth explanations or examples• comparisons with other languagesHowever, none of the above limitations are a negative criticism of the book; they merely define the book’s scope.What is the overall tone of the author’s writing style?All of the explanations are very straightforward, in the sense that they aren’t cluttered with excessive and unnecessary academic language. Most of the chapters use a tone where the author is “talking down” to a beginning-level reader, but the language is never disrespectful, condescending, or silly. The author is (presumably) assuming that the reader doesn’t know anything about Python and therefore requires simple and relatable explanations.What did I like about this book?I love that this ebook comes with a complete set of practice exercises for each chapter that are extremely well-made and maintained, and don’t require any additional expense to use. In my opinion, every single technical ebook should include similar practice exercises and problems (to the extent that the evaluation of answers can be automated). Most of the learning process for computer languages is nothing more than memorizing the names and syntax of methods, and the only way to solidify memories is through repetitive practice.I also love how thorough and organized the content is, relative to the beginner-level scope. Everything a Python novice needs to get started is included, and is presented in a reasonably logical order.What did I NOT like about this book?I was sometimes mildly annoyed that a small number of the practice exercises didn’t parse correctly, and the checker stubbornly insisted that my answers were incorrect (even when I cut and pasted the correct answer). However, nothing is graded and it’s perfectly easy to skip any of the exercises, so minor glitches aren’t worth fussing over.Most of time, when I got the answers wrong, it was my fault, so I can only blame myself for not taking the time to carefully think through the exercise. However, there are some instances where the expected answer is unusually specific, so there’s a little bit of guesswork involved in determining what is expected, even when those precise expectations aren’t always explicitly stated.My conclusionsWas reading and/or studying this book worthwhile for me?Completing all of the exercises for this ebook was one of the most helpful and enjoyable self-teaching experiences I’ve ever had, and I’ve tried many of the available online courses for Python. I wish there were a lot more books like this, especially for computer-parsable subjects like math.Would I recommend this book to others?If you already have a vague idea of what a computer program does and how it works, and just want to dive into learning Python, this ebook and the associated practice exercises are the perfect way to begin.What additional materials will others need to make use of this book?Toward the end of the ebook, you’ll need to start coding small programs on your own computer (rather than using the web portal), but the ebook provides the necessary information.It also helps to have the official Python documentation website open at all times, as a reference. Everything you need to know about the language is there, including some tutorials.My ratings (0.0-5.0)Quality of content: 5Quality of writing: 5Quality of editing: 5Value to myself: 5Potential value to others: 5Review-document metadataInitial completion date: 220401Review version and revision: V1R0Template version and revision: V1R2",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster.

"*edit, Feb 2022: This book helped me get my dream job (technical writer with a basic grasp of code). I do think it's worth supplementing with external exercises (potentially even app authoring), and I still think the author should develop a few select explanations in later chapters. That said, I consider this a strong, digestible resource with effective reinforcement.Original review, Nov 2021:I first started learning Python with a different book. While the material is accurate, it's also a bit dense. The intent seemed to be for the reader to automatically memorize everything that was written as soon as it was read. While I don't mind intensive study, it felt like a failure of expectation setting; the book is billed as a fast way to learn. It's not. I shelved it towards the end, when the fundamentals supposedly came together. There wasn't enough reinforcement of prior lessons, not enough practical/digestible examples for the material to sink in.I gave A Smarter Way to Learn Python a bash, and I'm happy to report I got through it in about a month of steady study. I could skip the odd day or two and be fine, since the exercises led to better retention. I remembered fundamentals from earlier chapters because they kept being used in later exercises. For example, the last set of exercises reuses fundamental math operators discussed in the first few chapters. I also appreciated the UX of the exercises; you can mark an answer as correct if you feel like you got credit (or enough of it right to pass), and you can mark others as trivial if you're ready to move on.A couple parts are glossed over too quickly for me. For instance, in Chapter 55 (about Classes), the author says the reason why you duplicate an attribute name after def __init__ is something the reader can explain to him when they're teaching at Stanford. While I respect honesty about one's limitations, this wasn't the best time for it. Part of the disappointment is that the author generally explains things in clear and digestible ways. As a consequence, the rare exceptions stand out in stark relief. If the author is wiling/able to clarify this in a future revision, that would be most welcome.Overall, I quite enjoyed the material and generally recommend it. My only tips are to a) take notes as you go (a Google Doc would be fine), and b) to use a robust IDE when the author asks you to use IDLE. VS Code with the Pylance extension is more than adequate, it more closely fits the kinds of editors in common use nowadays, and it's free.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster.

"I think that the short chapters are a double edged sword of sorts. Great, you read for very little time and have a few facts on the code and syntax fresh and ready for the exercises immediately after reading. Not so great, the author throws curveballs about some stuff and concepts that he didn't go over in the chapters. The author also has a way of posing the questions in a way that can induce the person doing the exercises to wonder what it is that he wants as an answer. I find it interesting that early on in the studies ""exercises"" he flashes a message about not quitting early on in one's programming studies and that, a person can get very upset at how he poorly poses some of these questions and seems to toss in material not gone over in these ""short"" chapters. I feel that he should be going over everything that he may test you on in the chapters and make them longer instead of surprising and confusing people with stuff posed in questions and answers which, strongly seem to indicate that he ""wants"" you to get stuff wrong and ""find"" new concepts in the answers as you get them wrong. This system seems engineered more to piss people off and encourage them to quit than to keep on with it. Further, I don't see how the ""retention"" is going to remain intact for long. He tosses something into questions from the previous chapter with little warning and, I have already forgotten it enough to get it wrong. Often, I feel that things are implied in the questions too often as though, we know everything he knows and, I find it massively frustrating to answer correctly with syntax only to find that my answer is being accused of being wrong. Lot of flaws in this system and I feel that this author or, the authors have some work to do to develop this into its best possible form. I would most strongly advise against signing up for any course the author advises you to take for purpose of getting a job which, ""uses his / their system"" since, this doesn't at all seem to have a real ability to get people into a programming language retained and usable state of being any faster than any other method. You'll be throwing more money away to take a course using this method than you will with simply buying one of these books. Forget about all of the talk about the 400% retention rate crap. What you go over briefly and, don't use consistently is NOT going to remain in your memory long enough to be of value. When he does go over things properly in his chapters and doesn't surprise with unsuspected elements inserted into questions, I do fine and get mostly correct answers. When he is posing questions in his implying manner and combining that with extra material not gone over in the chapters, I am getting many more questions wrong and becoming exasperated. Just another slick ""system"" to get your cash is my judgement until, they can develop this into something real.",3.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster.

"I've struggled for years to learn a coding language, and most people I knew that knew how to code would tell me to read this or that online, or give me a bunch of books to read, but I didn't know where to start and frankly, it left me intimidated by the process and I'd procrastinate my way out of doing it.  I could make sense of scripts that had already been written, but couldn't write something on my own to save myself.  My learning style needs a question to answer, the more specific the better, and ""how do I code?"" is just too general a question.After recently spending a few months unemployed and being asked in nearly every phone interview if I had any coding skills, I decided I needed to face the music and find a way to learn this stuff, even if it meant taking a class at a local college.  Python came up a lot, so that's where I headed.  I tripped over this book completely by accident, and while the bit about ""taught 50,000 people how to code, even grandmothers"" made me think it was BS, I bought it anyway.  I'm only 10 chapters in, and I have to say I love the way this book teaches.If you've already got some level of proficiency in Python, this isn't for you.  If you're trying to learn a new skill, or even just have a very basic understanding of coding, this breaks it down for you and the (free) online practice is excellent.  The author begins by telling you to not to spend too much time on it (25 minutes a session max) and don't pressure yourself, and then starts teaching with a lesson less than a page long.So far, it's working.  Previously learned lessons are incorporated into the following lessons, so information is reinforced as you learn the next bit and begins the process of driving the points home.  I'm looking forward to continuing, which is saying a lot, considering I was always too confused to really want to do any of it before this.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster.

"I am a tutor and I am using Mark Meyers' book ""A Smarter Way to Learn Python"" to introduce a sixth grade student to computer programming. The student was really not interested in taking on this subject matter, being a kid immersed in sketch drawing and YouTube animation videos and coming from a very computer-inexperienced family. She even protested a little as we got started.But the book and highly interactive tutorial immediately drew her in and she enthusiastically followed the instructions and prompts, and she performed the exercises with focused attention. When she completed the first lesson about the print statement, I told her she had just written and run her first computer program, and she beamed in delight!For sure I will continue with this book and Mark Meyers' other books on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery because this method of immediate interactive teaching using Mark's excellent tutorial exercises along with the Trinket online interactive coding environment makes for a powerful and fun learning experience. I highly recommend this book. The author is an excellent teacher, writer, and tutorial designer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster. Remember it longer.
"Myers actually does offer a better way to learn programming.  I found his HTML book to be the clearest of all the HTML books I tried. So when I took up Python, I bought Myers' book on Python.  He  clearly and simply explains and demonstrates each step in a short chapter, then there are interactive exercises at the end of the  chapter.The teaching method is excellent, with clear step-by-step explanations and online practice exercises.  Even where the concepts are familiar, it's good to get the practice so the nuances of a new language can soak in.  The problem is the typos.  Sometimes he leaves out a key term or puts the wrong word in his code examples.  I caught one such error in an early chapter, where I easily spotted the inconsistency with his other code examples.  Sorry I can't be more specific, since it wasn't like I could stick a post-it note in the page of the Kindle book.  But now that I'm in unfamiliar territory (chapter 68, dealing with CSV files), it was a lot harder to recognize that had used inconsistent names for the same variable ""reader_of_f"" in line 2 and ""contents_of_f"" in line 4.  Maybe the time it took me to dissect the sample code and discover the error has contributed to my comprehension of the subject, but I don't think it's the kind of pedagogy we want.I thought the chapters might be a little too repetitious for simple concepts.  I've done a bit of programming in the Arduino IDE, and  Python looks similar enough that I was sailing through the book and thinking it was a cinch.  When I stopped long enough to do some of the interactive exercises, however, I found that I needed to pay attention to practical items like where to put the parentheses, quotes, and punctuation.  It's like the difference between being able to understand a foreign language and being able to speak it.  So go ahead and skim through a chapter if you think you already understand it, but do enough of the interactive exercises to be sure that your confidence is justified and and that you can put the concepts into practice.",4.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster.

"For years, I have been avoiding the drudgery of learning another programming language. If you have been doing the same, then may I suggest that you try this method. You don't have much to lose.NOTE: When I clicked on the link in the Kindle edition I was re-directed. Ensure that the link displayed in the Kindle is what actually appears in the browser before registering or you may register for the wrong programming language.Update: I have gone through 82% of the book and had to change my review to four stars instead of five, which means I still recommend it highly. I took one star off for two reasons;1) The author REALLY emphasizes learning by doing much more than understanding. This is arguably the best approach to get you coding fast. So, on two occasions so far he would say something to the effect that ... he does not know why and if you find out you can write him and let him know. Since I like to know why, I had to refer to other books. So depending on your personality, you may have to refer to other texts, which is not unusual when you are learning.2) There are some errors. Mostly you will realize these are errors when you start to do the exercises and or refer to other texts, so look out for them. Unfortunately most Python texts are terse and dry so I will not recommend others at this time but if I have a change of heart I’ll review them so you can watch my reviews.All in all a stellar effort and I wished I could have given it 4.3 stars but Amazon does not allow for that. If you can't learn Python with this then I have NO idea what advice to give.

"My reviews of Mark's other books will show I am a very enthusiastic customer. Have gotten the Kindle editions of his HTML/CSS, JavaScript and now his Python book (all very inexpensively, I might add). This is the the best way to learn the basic, underlying mechanics of a programming language, because you are constantly practicing it all the way through, with short, seemingly simple chapters, that especially at first seem a little too easy. But this is how you commit it to memory and make sure you are understanding how it works beyond surface syntax once things get a little more complicated.As I've noted I worked through several of Mark's books, the only one I haven't yet tackled is his  jQuery book. I'm still inexperienced enough though to not be sure if the reason this book seemed a little less in depth on its subject compared to the JavaScript book is due to his books or due to differences between the languages being covered. Maybe JavaScript is just more complicated to learn? Or maybe Python seemed a little easier to me as I have learned several different languages at this point (having also previously learned PHP through another online source and JavaScript being the first programming language I learned after coming back after long break from first learning programming back in technical school in the early 2000's), so am unsure if just my perception has changed as to how hard it was to learn thus affecting how I view the book when reviewing?Either way, I'm still convinced this is the best way to get started in a language, then you have a great, firm foundation on which to base further, more in depth learning of a language to use in a career in the future. I should also mention, there were some errors/glitches in the exercises and in the book, but Mark gives you easy opportunity to contact him telling him where the issues exist. He always responds and acknowledges that he's heard your report of the mistakes. Still I gave it five stars as it's a great way to learn.

"What sets ""A Smarter Way to Learn Python"" apart from other books is that it compels you to immediately practice what you've learned.  The chapters are *extremely* short and encompass one primary topic.  You then drill that one topic with a series of online questions.  The questions always follow the same format asking you the same sorts of questions in different ways.  An analogy would be trying to learn names from pictures:  you could look at a list of names and match up the pictures or your could look at the pictures and match up the names.  In both cases you're doing the same thing, but because you've changed the way in which you do it, you learn it a little more thoroughly.  The online questions for the book operate in the same fashion.I don't expect to be a Python expert by the time I complete the book, but I do find it to be a relatively engaging way to absorb the material.  It's not the only tool one would need to learn the language but it's one tool.I recommend the book for getting started with this language.  A nice bonus is that you don't have to get bogged down in installing a Python editor or anything on your computer.  Everything happens through the website so it helps you determine if you want to go further with it.  One final thing to recommend it is that if you want to learn it in little chunks, you can.  Each chapter plus online exercises will take you five minutes or so.  Unlike the chapters in most other books which will take you much longer, you can pick up and put down this one throughout the day.  That aspect works well for me.  The drawback is that you're clearly not getting the full depth of the material, but what you do learn, you learn pretty well.  Again, this goes back to the notion that you're not going to be an expert upon completion, but you should know enough that if you want to become an expert, you can.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster.

"I've just started to learn to code in general and had started with codecademy.com learning Python. While codecademy is wonderful, I quickly found myself forgetting certain characters to include and felt like I needed a physical reference for me to be able to be successful. Interesting enough, on my search for ""Best"" Python training guides and books I came across this. Being as I felt I still wanted a physical copy (just something about a book in your hands makes it real), I ordered the paperback version.  That leads me to this. I didn't quite realize just how much more helpful this book was going to be! I decided to set aside codecademy for a moment and catch up with the book. This was a great idea. At least for me. This is why. When I was a kid I struggled with Algebra because of all the rules you just had to take at face value and the ""why"" seemed to always be missing. I grew to love physics, because the entire goal of physics is to explain ""How?"" and ""Why?"". I know this seems like a tangent but I have a point. If you are like me and need to know how and why a thing works so you can understand it inside and out or if you have struggled with following seemingly arbitrary rules ( of course they aren't arbitrary, it can just seem like that early on) then this book is fantastic.Mark spends time helping you to understand all the pieces in a very clear way so that way you understand them fundamentally and makes it easier to remember to do things the right way because you know why it should be.  Don't get me wrong here, I fully plan on heading back over to codecademy and other free sources, in fact, I'm excited too, but this is helping me grasp my first coding language so I CAN enjoy and thrive with those other sources.While I am not all the way through this book I feel like I am already moving at a great pace while really grasping what I'm doing in a far more constructive way that will really help build my foundation.

"I bought GAWP over a year ago, when I was working on a Genetic Algorithm chapter for my book Math Adventures with Python. I've had a lot of experience with Python, so I didn't need a tutorial on strings and variables. If you're new to Python or programming, you might want to start with another book. Sheppard throws the reader into the deep end. But the projects cover all the classics of GA's, like the 8 Queens Puzzle, Magic Squares, Sudoku and the project I was particularly interested in, the Traveling Salesman Problem.Other reviewers have complained about the author's use of Python's unittest module, but it might be the reason his code runs 2 or 3 times faster than mine. It's a great hands-on introduction to testing, as well. Another bonus is Sheppard recommends using Pycharm for an editor.After writing a bunch of code to solve the first problem in the book, Guess the Password, Sheppard takes the code that will just be repeated in every future program and extracts it to a ""genetic"" file that will be reused, possibly with some modifications, for the rest of the book. This risky move is a stroke of genius, but one that is clearly lost on some reviewers. It's true, the author only includes a handful of graphics and charts in the entire book, and it's not easy to keep track of which function/method goes where at first (or second!).Having said all that, the book contains absolutely indispensable projects for the intermediate programmer interested in really delving into using Genetic Algorithms to solve puzzles and problems. Challenging as it is, I keep going back to this book to work on problems. It's not the type of book you'll only go through once; but you'll keep learning something every time you work on one of its projects. All the code is available in the appendix and online.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Genetic Algorithms with Python
"I like this book a lot. One of the things I like about it is that the author takes a lot of different examples, and step-by-step teaches you the elements of genetic algorithms, and also improves the algorithms over the course of the book.I'd say if you want to learn genetic algorithms this is certainly a good book. I'll be looking for some more theoretical books to round out my knowledge, but this is a great start for someone who knows python, but isn't super familiar with how genetic algorithms work.One of the things I don't like about the book is that it doesn't actually talk about the overall concept of what genetic algorithms do in a way that makes it super easy to apply to other problems. I do think the point of the step-by-step approach was to give you some of that, but somehow it didn't quite work for me I needed a little bigger picture explanations of the conceptual frameworks behind the code that he uses.But the author does, with each subsequent chapter, add new, more complex concepts and new ways to do mutation and checking fitness, which is great.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Genetic Algorithms with Python
"Overall, good introduction to genetic algorithms for those without a mathematical background. Focuses on a high level view of concepts and applications.The Good: The author is clear, which makes the book easy to read. The code is written well, albeit, for the consumption of a CS major than a generalist. The examples are short and fun to work with. The book is much easier to read than more rigorous texts on genetic algorithms.The Bad: The author chose to use `unittest` for running the genetic algorithms which makes the code difficult to read at times, and kind of annoying to work with. I'm a statistician, and although I do run tests for my programs, I prefer to not use `unittest` unless it's absolutely necessary.Overall, I like this book, even though the print quality may not be great. But the low print quality may be the reason why this book is affordable.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Genetic Algorithms with Python
I got the first program working and am working through the rest of the material.  It focuses heavily on the Python programming environment. I have read and understand the first half of the first chapter.  The author jumps quickly into object oriented programming style which I am not familiar.  i am hoping to extract information about how to design genotypes and fitness tests.  I am trying to use the information to program an artificial neural network.  I will continue to think and study this book.  It seems to be a book worth the time to learn.  My background in procedural programming style of programming is being challenged by the conversion to object oriented programming style.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Genetic Algorithms with Python
"This was a great book to learn Python as well as genetic algorithms. I thought the problems were very interesting and the code is written so that it gets more sophisticated with each problem.

"I hate to be the Debbie Downer here, but...this book has you trudging through hours of idiosyncratic python code just to get to a program that flips bits from 0 to 1. It's another python book that succeeds in taking the fun and exploration out of programming. The author claims that the language used is not that important, but the obtuse nature of the code belies a possible primary intent to turn a personal code library into an additional source of income, with the goal of teaching the material in an engaging way taking a secondary back-seat.I remember many years ago, in a computer science class, using Lisp and genetic algorithms to optimize the travelling salesman problem. I was pretty amazed at the results that were obtained with maybe 3/4 page worth of code. That is how you get someone engaged in a powerful programming paradigm. This is not the way. There may be a lot of good, even very good information, in this book. But, the amount of boilerplate and noise is just unreasonable.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Genetic Algorithms with Python

It's really fun to curl up in a comfortable chair and learn from physical pages. I hoped this book would allow that, but it doesn't. The header sections that introduce the topic are useful, but the examples seldom clearly show the use case of the topic.

"This is the best Python book I've found for beginners. It assumes you know nothing about programming. The lessons are concise and easy to follow. The writing is straightforward.However, the exercises provided do not contain any solutions whatsoever, not even model solutions. So if you don't have someone who already knows programming, it can be tough to figure out the right code. One star off for this.Also, this book is for Python 2.7, and some of the examples are outdated for Python 3 +. For example, all the code examples use print without a parenthesis. Run this in Python 3 and you'll get an error. For best results, use the book with an instructor who knows what they're doing.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python in 24 Hours Sams Teach Yourself
"Overall I really liked the book. It was well written, explaining concepts very simply, that a beginner should be able to understand. By the very nature of this book (1 hour per chapter, over 24 hours), this book is not inclusive of all that is Python, but it covers the basics very well. I would honestly suggest this book as _the_ book to read for someone with no prior programming or Python experience. BUT, it does fall short in a few places, so this book should be supplemented with other resources after having read it to fill in the gaps. I realize that this book was not intended to be something like the Llama book (which is extremely verbose), it does not mention things that I often wonder if a beginner might get lost/confused on. Regardless, the basics are covered very well and I would recommend this without hesitation.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python in 24 Hours Sams Teach Yourself
"Pretty handy python guide for beginners. I work with 3-4 books and keep coming back to this one. The gap in the market for me is a cookbook that doesn't cost me an arm and a leg. And also happens to be credible. What annoys me about most of these books are the ""real world"" examples. In Sam's our busy chef is composing python scripts to produce a menu and organise table seating. Pretty impractical. I'd rather see examples that everyone can adapt and use - like bookmarking websites, creating my own Feedly or email newsletters. Certainly not another music/video library system!

The rest of the book was great, aside from some small typos (which I actually thought might be due to it being a Kindle version and not a printed version of the book).  It did what it said it would - I learned the basics of Python.  My issue, though, is in the fact that someone could publish a book that contains an incomplete or invalid chapter - I would love to know what is missing in Hour 17, but I will have to try to figure it out on my own, or rely on someone who is not a beginner to assist me.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Python in 24 Hours Sams Teach Yourself

"This book goes very well with the free MITx courses available online.  The book covers the same material as the online lectures.  So you could do the online lectures without the book.  However, the book does go into a little more detail and is a more convenient medium for reviewing concepts than re-watching a lot of video.  The focus is not on learning syntax.  The focus is on learning how to break down problems and create solutions.  So it is ok for people who want to start learning Python.

I found Sedgewick's original book Programming in Python - An intermediate approach, to be a very solid resource with a chockful of exercises BUT that book is version outdated (Python 2.x) and their new book uses Java.

"When the socialite Kylie Jenner asked on Twitter ""Can you guys please recommend books that made you cry?"", the response from one follower was ""Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (2nd Edition)"".It is true books about coding are rarely easy going. However there are some that, through the clarity of thought and precision of expression, are satisfying to struggle with. ""The C Programming Language (2nd Edition)"" by Kernighan and Ritchie from 1988 springs to mind, the book that brought us ""Hello, World!"".For that most accessible of computer languages, Python, there is a wealth of excellent books published to introduce the language. However in its 3rd Edition, ""Introduction to Computation and Programmimg Using Python"" by John Vogel Guttag takes some beating.The book was initially developed from material used on a single semester course at MIT, using Python to introduce Computer Science. It has since been expanded considerably. Although it works well as a text for formal education, it can also be used alongside MIT's hugely successful and highly recommended (free) MOOCs, 6.00.1x and 6.00.2x or as a primer for somebody wanting to learn or improve their Python with a view to using it in a scientific or social science setting. In particular this is an excellent primer for those wanting to work in the field of data science or machine learning, especially if their formal exposure to algorithms, probability and statistical inference is limited. The latest version includes a chapter on the pandas library, supplementing material in the previous edition that touched on numpy and scipy, and it covers plotting (using matplotlib) more extensively than in the 2nd Edition.This is not a dry tome. Throughout the book, Guttag's sense of humour and erudition shines through. His asides cover everything from Babbage to baseball, from Ptolemy to Turing. Each chapter summarises the terms introduced in the chapter and there is an excellent Python 3.8 quick reference guide at the end of the book. As would be expected, the book is copiously indexed and cross-referenced, accompanying code is available to download and most of the material can be supplemented with videos available on YouTube.The book covers subjects such as object-oriented programming, dynamic programming and algorithmic complexity and introduces some of the most important algorithms in the field of computer science. The book falls short of discussing other important machine learning libraries, such as sklearn or tensorflow, does not address Python's support for functional programming and does not cover important commercial tools such as database management systems or graphical user interfaces. However Guttag covers a lot of well-paced ground in the book's 637 pages, by the end of which you will have become competent in using Python to perform systematic problem solving, data analysis and computational modelling to address real world challenges.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python third edition: With Application to Computational Modeling and Understanding Data
"I haven't coded for 20 years and got this book as an intro to Python. It is written very well and presents the information in a way that is very useful -- it assumes you know very little and talks you through things. I'm about 1/4 of the way through and having fun trying out new ways of combining the few things I've learned so far. However, there are at least 3 mistakes in the first quarter of the book that could easily trip up those who are truly newcomers to programming, who might not immediately say ""Hey, that doesn't seem right...""On page 25 it talks about double or single quotes as a way to enclose a string. The examples provided show a double quote example but the other example lacks quotes altogether and would not work. The code snippet at the bottom of page 38 is just plain wrong, even allowing for another line alluded to in the prior paragraph but not written out. I see no way that the format function in that code snippet could possibly work, and had to try many other versions of what the code was trying to do in order to make it work as intended. And on page 39 they talk about using \ as an escape character in a string but in the text there is a point where they use a / instead, which does nothing. Also, amusingly, on page 3 is an invitation to ""Click below to get this free PDF guide"".

"This is the resource to use if you want to learn PyQt from scratch. No other web site or book comes close.PyQt is a difficult framework to learn. It is an incredibly opinionated, sprawling, complex ecosystem. It also will pretty much let you do anything you want, really easily, once you understand the framework. Those developers really know what they are doing: if you want something done right in the world of GUIs, do it with Qt. Unfortunately there are not many good up-to-date resources on PyQt programming. Summerfield's tour de force, published in 2008,  is woefully out of date and pretty much not usable any more. The community has needed a replacement, and Moore's book sets the new standard.Starting with very simple widgets in Chapter 2, and working up to much more complex examples, including how to show video, threading, building a browser, and SQL interface, this book covers all of the basics, and then some, in a lucid readable way.One danger with Qt programming is that the authors can go down the rabbit hole of detail. Instead of focusing on the big picture (e.g., how do you connect a signal to a slot), they end up deep into minutiae that you will not use that often (e.g., custom delegates inside of a tree view). This book does a great job keeping the big picture in mind, and explaining how the framework is supposed to work, with just enough detail. For instance, the explanation of the model-view framework is amazing, probably the best I have ever seen (though to be fair the author does skimp on the delegate).I take away one star because the examples are too complicated and this detracts for me. Instead of starting with a simple single widget with a single button on it, he starts with a huge window with tons of widgets on it, with tabs. This is overwhelming at first, and makes following the code in the book harder: what am I reading about, where am I? Show one or two full code examples. This is especially problematic in Chapter 6, where the one example (game_lobby.py) confusingly mixes together multiple different ways to style your application. It would be much more clear to have four or so apps in this chapter, each one showing a simple concept. I guess the book is so long already this makes it hard to do this, but it would make it a lot easier to follow the code, and the book.Also, it would be really helpful if the book had a dependency graph at the beginning, showing which Chapters depend on others. There are definitely enough moving parts in this book that this would help.Frankly these are not major criticisms: it takes work to figure out the examples sometimes, but they are explained well and the book is just great.One MINOR quibble: he does not follow the standard import conventions for PyQt, but that is not a big deal it is easy to switch over -- at least he doesn't use 'import *' which some authors do and they should be taken to the woodshed for it.Take home message: for a framework as large, unwieldy, and confusing as PyQt, Moore has succeeded in imposing a useful order on the chaos, explaining things really well, and providing the ultimate beginner's guide that will let you build extremely powerful Guis from scratch.  If you want to learn PyQt, get this book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Mastering GUI Programming with Python: Develop impressive cross-platform GUI applications with PyQt
"Unfortunately, there is (or was) very little practical guidance available for using PyQt5. The library documentation is severely lacking (in a lot of cases the reader is left to the Qt C++ docs) and the few good books I've read were stuck in PyQt4 and in one case Python 2. Therefore I was happy to come across this title recently while searching for a more up-to-date text.Well... not so fast. I did learn a few things I didn't know already, but there are so many problems with this edition, and specifically the Kindle version, I'm not sure I'd recommend it to someone who wants to do serious development with Python and PyQt.First of all, there are many pages blank or almost blank, that was a bad first impression. Second, (and this may well be limited to the Kindle version) the code formatting is horrible, indenting is semantic in Python and many code samples are not indented properly. Third, the narrative describing the code snippets is confusing. The author is verbose explaining the functionality and yet there were many times I had to figure out on my own exactly where I was supposed to put it, sometimes it was in another class completely without mention. Fourth, there's the sample code itself. I don't personally download code for programming books because I prefer to type it all in to enhance my learning, but trying to do that with this one was frustrating at best. I spent a day and a half debugging one of the sample applications which had at least three show stopping bugs, one of which was a glaring design flaw by the author. I actually had to go to the C++ source to figure it out where the author erred and did a pretty significant refactoring to get it to work as it should. It was as if this code had never been tested at all. Finally, the table of contents would indicate a fairly broad spectrum of the APIs available in modern Qt, however, it's a bit scattershot and most of them are not covered in much detail. The entire book feels more like an introduction than a practical guide to ""mastering"" anything, which is fine if you know that's what you're paying for.

However this isn't without it's faults, as another reviewer mentioned the book could use some editing in certain places where the words chosen may seem a bit convoluted and other times unclear.The impact of this isn't too detrimental but still it left me with some question marks about what the author wanted to say on certain pages.

"Full disclosure. I was provided a copy of the book by Packt for free and in return, I promised that I would create a review on Amazon. Please note that the publisher did not put any stipulations on the review. In other words, I did not have to provide a positive review.The book is a tour deforce as to what one needs to consider when it comes to writing clean code. It begins by stating that there is no sole or strict definition for clean code. It goes on to say that tools like linters help but that there is no way to create a formal measurement for clean code.It explains that this is because programming is not about communicating with machines but that it is about communicating ideas to other developers. In other words, clean code is like pornography, you know it when you see it.The tour de force covers standard topics like inheritance in detail. The discussion of inheritance begins with the standard warning that each time that a sub-class is manifested, tight coupling is also created. Remember that coupling is a yucky thing.The book provides two questions to help determine whether or not the inheritance design is appropriate. The first question asks whether or not all inherited methods are used? The second question asks how many methods are overridden? If you are not using all the methods and are overriding many methods, it is probably a design mistake.After you have determined that you probably have a design mistake, it talks about some of the potential causes. For example, a superclass may be vaguely defined and contain too much responsibility. This in turn enables corrective action.The preceding generalities are then concretized by using http.server from the Python Standard Library as an example of when to use inheritance. Afterward, the book provides anti-patterns.It doesn't stop there, it then goes on to cover multiple inheritance. It begins by explaining why Python does not have the diamond problem. The diamond problem is the usual standard reason for not using multiple inheritance.Mixins are the last topic related to inheritance that is covered. Mixins are demonstrated using a parser that takes a string and provides iteration over it by values separated with hyphens. This functionality is implemented via a BaseTokenizer. The next level of complexity is that want values to be in the upper case. One solution is to just create a new class. In this case, you can't do that because a lot of classes are already extending BaseTokenizer and don't want to impact them. The solution is to create UpperIterableMixin and then use multiple inheritance to create Tokenizer(UpperIterable, BaseTokenizer).Other topics related to clean code are covered in just as much depth. That is why the book is 423 pages long.Like anything in real life, the book is not perfect. The goal of the book is clean code. However, it spends time in minutia like an entire section titled ""Delegating into smaller coroutines – the 'yield from' syntax"". The other side of this is that it ignores topics in Python like multiprocessing and subprocess. However, these are just minor warts because nothing is ever perfect.The bottom line is that the cost of the book will pay itself the first time that you apply any of its concepts. A book, with editors and tech reviewers, ensures high-quality content. When you look at blogs on the internet, you never know what you will get.The other advantage of a book is its table of contents. It will quickly limit the number of items that have to look at as well as providing a structure for those items. When you Google, how many blogs will you have to look at before finding what you need and determining its quality?Again, let me emphasize that the investment in the book is well worth it.faThe Bit Plumber",4.0 out of 5 stars,Clean Code in Python: Develop maintainable and efficient code 2nd Edition
"I’m a long time C#, .NET developer and have read and absorbed and taken to heart Uncle Bob’s Clean Code and Clean Architecture books.  Recently I’ve started learning Python and, with any programming language I learn, I like to also learn the best way to use that language and how to develop clean code and clean architectures with it.This is why I love Mariano Anaya’s second edition of “Clean Code in Python” book.  It immediately meets both of my requirements here.  But is not only a great book for Python newbies, like me, but experienced Python devs will definitely find a lot of value from it.Mariano does a great job explaining the what and the why of each topic. He wants you to understand the pros and cons of each approach.  He explains each side of the argument, showing various alternatives, to help you understand the best approach and avoid common mistakes.I loved this quote from Mariano, “Practicality beats purity.”  He gives you solid, practical, real-world examples and shows when to deviate from pure patterns sometimes – to be practical. He has great, long-term design thinking with considerations for future changes in mind, making your software flexible and extensible – the Pythonic way.He starts with simple examples to help you understand the concepts then moves on to more advanced topics, including describing how Python works under the covers.A takeaway summary:• Emphasizes the Pythonic way to code.• Best practices and traits of software design , anti-patterns, debugging tips.• Has an entire chapter on the SOLID principles. Also touches on these principles throughout the book.• Explains the power of decorators and descriptors, an advanced Python feature, to improve your code.• Covers generators, iterators, coroutines, and asynchronous programming.• Importance of unit testing. Shows how to make code more unit testable and that it is just as important as production code.• Describes the importance of refactoring and shows the importance of unit tests to make this work effectively.• Common design patterns and how they contribute to clean code. Design patterns considerations for Python since there are many patterns already inherently embedded in Python.• Great chapter on clean architectureHighly recommended!A few of my favorite quotes:“The ideas explored in this chapter are fundamental pillars in the global context of the book because of their importance to our ultimate goal: to write better and more maintainable software.”“The reason why we pay so much attention to the code's flexibility is that we know requirements change and evolve over time, and eventually, as domain business rules change, our code will have to change as well to support these new requirements.”“As introduced at the beginning, the goal of this book was not to give you recipes or formulas that you can apply directly, but rather to develop your critical thinking. Idioms and syntax features come and go; they change over time. But ideas and core software concepts remain. With these tools and the examples provided, you should have a better understanding of what clean code means.”",5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean Code in Python: Develop maintainable and efficient code 2nd Edition
"This is a useful book, especially as Python slowly becomes one of the dominant programming languages. Much of the information I have learned over the course of 15+ years of Python programming, so it's nice to see it in one place. And, to be honest, there were some back-end, low-level Python information that I didn't know.You'll find a lot of the information scattered around other books; there are some topics that I covered in my own books. But, again, for new Python programmers and those who spend most of their time using Python for data science, having a single source is good.The book starts with the fundamentals of good documentation and code formatting. Believe me, I've seen a lot of code that was obviously written by C/C++ programmers who were forced to write Python code for a one-off need, and it's not pretty.Chapter 2 talks about some of the ""back-end"" Python work. It's not totally low-level, e.g. how the underlying C code is used to make Python work, but does go into detail about some of the functionality of Python data structures.We then move into more information similar to Chapter 1: good code traits, SOLID principles, decorators, descriptors, testing, etc. While you can learn these over time if you hang out on programming forums, blogs, etc., the variety of opinions, especially from the anti-Python crowd, can make it hard to understand what is ""Pythonic"".Overall, this is a very valuable book for new Python programmers and those Python users who don't delve into general purpose programming. In addition, there is more detailed explanations for common Python ""tools"" that even long-time Python users might find useful, or at least interesting.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean Code in Python: Develop maintainable and efficient code 2nd Edition
"Lots of good information in this book on best practices for Python software engineering as well as general software engineering, this book could definitely form the basis for a software engineering or related class in a university. I think it is useful to anyone with at least 6 months of substantial Python experience (e.g. you've coded in Python several times a week for at least 6 months). Ideally, you should have done at least one big Python project under your belt.Overall it's very well-written, and it follows a good logical progression of simple to complex ideas. But as one other reviewer said, it's extremely dense with information. It takes a lot of concentration to read through the material because of this. This is good in my opinion, but be prepared to take breaks throughout reading it to catch your mental breath.There an error in the book I already caught and I assume more.  Looks like it could've used more proofreading. The first error I found is the first example of documentation in the book on page 11: it's supposed to show the docs for the update function of dicts but only shows the last line. In my experience, Packt doesn't always do thorough enough proofreading and errors like this tend to show up in their books. So if something seems confusing in the book, be aware that it may be due to an error.

"Clean Code in Python - Second Edition has helped me begin to fill some of the gaps in my code education. My sincere thanks to Packt Publishing for giving me the opportunity to review it!PROS:- It's great for an inexperienced developer. The author clearly knows his stuff. I would be hard-pressed to name another Python book that goes into this level of detail.- This is an excellent technical reference for Python. I can envision a time when, thanks to this book, I won't have to visit StackOverflow half as much.CONS:This book is DENSE. It truly is a reference text wherein the author gets down to business and doesn't tiptoe around the point. Some authors are horrible about that and fill their work with unnecessary anecdotes or ridiculous metaphors. This author did none of that. To me however, the lack of anecdotes detracts somewhat from the readability.BOTTOM LINE:The best thing about this book is the real-world use cases highlighted by the author. I typically work alone when I code but could see how his development team-oriented approach would apply. It's a good reminder to make your code readable to other humans since, as he put it, the code is for us, not for the machine.In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to clean up their act: one-person or small development teams, rogue analysts, or hobbyists looking to take the plunge into production coding.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean Code in Python: Develop maintainable and efficient code 2nd Edition

Finally, the solution is shown. However, for the person for whom all the commands are brand-new, how a person knows how to put them all together in order to solve the problem is not at all clear. ""I would never think of coming up with that solution.""At the end of each chapter, the reader is referred to a half dozen or so exercises. These are found online and consist of problems that are part of international competitions for students. Some are easily enough solvable, but some are not for people who are barely familiar with the required techniques. They are test questions, not practice questions. Even worse, you are suggested to submit your solutions to the online ""judge,"" which is very thorough. In other words, you may have a solution that works for all the standard cases you have in mind, but the judge tests it against other, non-standard cases, and you may find yourself with no way to see what you did wrong. If this makes you too frustrated, I'd suggest just finding your own solutions and not submitting them to the judge.People who have a knack for ""computational thinking"" may not run into the difficulties I did.

The author's style is very readable and exercises are provided at the end of each chapter (if I were teaching a class in Python IOT development, I'd use this as my textbook). Even if you simply read throughPractical Python Programming for IoT rather than working through the examples physically, the author's notes and explanations make it a very worthwhile experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Python Programming for IoT: Build advanced IoT projects using a Raspberry Pi 4 MQTT RESTful APIs WebSockets and Python 3

"An engaging and edifying book, to be sure, but a ""gotcha"" to be aware of for the Kindle edition (or at least in my Kindle copy): super-scripts representing exponentials are entirely absent!  A number like ""63"" is represented just like that whether it's supposed to simply be 63 or 6^3, and this flaw is very consistent throughout.  In a book riddled with mathematical equations, it took me a bit of time to figure out why sometimes his math was so far off, even senseless!  Then I began to check if at such times his values were actually exponentials, and it made sense.  Still a very good book, but hard to imagine why they couldn't have been more careful about super-scripting where needed.

"This book covers the basics of discrete mathematics which opens avenues to broader computing projects. As an initiate in the study of computer science, I always believed that the mathematics of the ""continuous element"" was the most interesting part of engineering analysis. Apart from the necessary introduction to the notions of discrete probability, elementary theory of counting, the theory of graphs, and other additional topics, I did not give it the importance that it had. And this book showed me how wrong I was, because it is a special book for those who decide to learn the discipline in a self-taught way.The way of explaining the topics is very clear, concise, rigorous. In particular, combinatorial analysis and graph theory are presented in a way that satisfies the awake reader. The entire book is presented as separate units and is very enjoyable for anyone who wants to take this discipline seriously. It is an excellent introduction to the subject, a preamble to further studies of algorithms and computation.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical Discrete Mathematics: Discover math principles that fuel algorithms for computer science and machine learning with Python

Most of the books I previously came across had a lot of math and were not very intuitive. I love this book, because it does not only explain things in a way that someone not familiar with the topic would understand, but it also goes further to give some examples on how to actually apply things.

"Disclaimer: The publisher asked me to review this book and gave me a review copy. I promise to be 100% honest in how I feel about this book, both the good and the less so.OverviewThis book is intended for someone who wants to automate some tasks, but may not be an overly technical person.  They may have a Python background, but not necessarily so.  They may be developers, but don't have to be.  They just need to get something done, and don't want to keep doing it by hand.What I Like:This is a wide ranging book that gives the reader an opportunity to learn about libraries and techniques that they probably haven't seen before.  Each section, or recipe, is set up the same.  It starts with Getting Ready, which lists the required libraries, their version, and the command to set it up.  Next is How To Do It, which gives the code.  The code is, of course, available through the Packt website, as it is for any book with code.  Then we have How It Works, which changes back to a more conversational tone and talks through the code example.  The fourth section is There's More, which gives you a few tips to extend what was just taught.  Each recipe finishes up with See Also, where you see what other recipes are related to the current one.  This standard structure makes it easy to read through a recipe and focus on what you need.What I Don't Like:The title of this section is probably a little too strong.  It would be better to say, What I Don't Prefer.  However, this is how I've been organizing these reviews, and that's what I'l stick with for now.So what I don't prefer are the last few sections.  Chapter 11 is about using machine learning.  Anyone who has been following my book reviews knows that I love machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence.  This chapter, though, uses Google Cloud, which is an entirely different beast than what has been discussed.  Machine learning itself is a skill to be learned, as is Google Cloud.  It also sticks out as the only section in the book that uses anything from Google.  I personally would have preferred to learn about using Python with Google Drive products, such as Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Sites.  Many people use these technologies, and would probably welcome automating using them.  Thankfully, the author finishes up with testing and debugging, which a less technical person will probably need.What I Would Like to See:Given how useful I tend to find cookbooks, I would like to see more recipes.  As you would expect from having personal expectations, there are plenty of recipes that I don't think I'll need.  But do I still gain value from them?  Yes.  It gives me an idea of what is possible that I haven't thought about yet.  Maybe I'll need them one day.  Or maybe I can use this book to guide someone else who has a question.  It's a good reference book for a library all around.I can easily give this book a 5 out of 5.  It is very useful with both the specific recipes as well as how they are organized.  I would be very happy to see more books like this from Packt and would like to thank the author for this one.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python Automation Cookbook: 75 Python automation ideas for web scraping data wrangling and processing Excel reports emails and more 2nd Edition
"Really appreciate any book that starts off driving home the importance of setting virtual environments properly. Yes, a lot of information now days can be searched online, but if you are here, you are willing to chip in a little for a fresh set of neatly laid out concepts – and this book is just that. It is a great compilation of relatable example driven concepts. Regular expression, argument parsing, logging, directory manipulation, reading txt/pdf/image/csv/word/excel files are all bread and butter now days and if any of these topics daunted you, this book gives you a nice high-level intro into them. The web sections were great for me who has really only scrapped the web, I was exposed to other ideas such as automated emails and text messages.

Disclaimer: I was offered a review copy by the publisher to write an honest review.I skimmed through this book over the course of a week paying close attention to the code samples. The writing is really very good and didn't set off any of my grammar alarms that are constantly waiting in the background when I'm reading anything. That made the technical bits a lot more enjoyable.There were a lot of examples that were light and that you could go through from start to finish without getting mired in complicated logic. I didn't find any issues with the code itself which was also nice.If I had to offer a critique for a 2nd edition (if it remains a cookbook style offering) it would be to maybe explain less and show more.

"The book starts with the current state of play, then modern development environments (with Python packages and how to use stuff so that you can install local environments that won't potentially conflict with other stuff).Then there's new stuff like dictionary operations and comparisons with other languages.Then interfaces etc.Concurrency is about threads, multithreading and multiprocessing and how to avoid (road)blocks.Event driven programming and it's not threading, but can be used with message queues and for things like GUIs.Metaprogramming and what it is (and isn't)Bridging the gap with C and C++ allows Python to be extended with C/C++ (which can allow for faster operation for specific functions).Testing and QA is all about making sure your code is doing the right thing and in an optimal manner.Packaging and distributing code is just that and best practices for writing Python packages.Observing Application Behavior and Performance, making sure the code is doing what it's meant to and logging and such like.And finally code optimisation which can be speeding up code and making it more efficient by improving data structures.All in all it's a very good overview and gives some easy to understand examples while not getting bogged down with extraneous instructions on say all the complexities of a framework.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Expert Python Programming: Master Python learning the best coding practices and advanced programming concepts 4th Edition
"About This BookSo you think you know Python? I bet you don’t, at least not to this level. But this book can change that. While you might know how to do most anything in the language, can you write C extensions for a performance boost? How are your metaprogramming skills? Can you handle concurrent programming? This book discusses all of these and a lot more.Who Is This For?The primary audience for this is a very experienced programmer that uses advanced Python in a production environment. Those of us who use Python for simpler problems will also get some useful tips and tricks from this book as well.OrganizationAt first, I was perplexed that there was no macrostructure to this book, but after looking at the table of contents, I realized that would have been difficult. Each of the topics after the first few introductory chapters is completely different with little to no relationship. Within each chapter, however, the author placed Technical Requirements and Summary sections. This helps the reader understand what they need to know before reading the chapter as well as give a refresher afterward.Did This Book Succeed?I think this is a great book to learn those last bits of Python that most people miss. Want to keep up with the latest on the language? There’s a chapter about that. Want to improve your testing automation? This book discusses it. It’s THE book to top off your Python programming abilities.Rating and Final ThoughtsOverall, I give this book a 5 out of 5.If you’re a Python developer, get this book to learn a few new skills that your fellow devs won’t know. You’ll learn new techniques and refine old ones that will let you program in new ways. It belongs on your bookshelf.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Expert Python Programming: Master Python learning the best coding practices and advanced programming concepts 4th Edition
"The early part of the book is excellent for those just getting started and later parts of the book appear to be excellent resources for very advanced users.  The Python history can be useful yet it was not tediously long.The early part of the book is a step by step getting started from scratch.  Following the rules and procedures laid out here will save you a great deal of time later.  The term “Isolation” is one of the key words in this area.Good quick review of history and justifications for moving to version 3.Very good list of resources for python sharing communities.Introduction to the Python Package Index PyPi guides you to an enormous wealth of tools.The comparison with other languages does not try to over-sell Python.  It freely admits that other languages have some very strong points but does show many of the key advantagbes of Python over a wide range of projects.One of my favorite advanced areas is the Multi-threading topics.  In this age of servers with 4, 8, 16 and more processors, this can be so powerful and the book lays out how to accomplish this and thus assist you to implement some key programs to have parallel processing.Chapters 8 and beyond opened up new areas that were brand new to me and most programmers I work with.

"As the title might imply, ""Expert Python Programming"" is a book that will take your Python skills to the next level. The book covers a wide range of topics in Python - it contains a solid amount of historical information regarding the current state of Python 3.9 and recent additions to the language, as well as plenty of technical information regarding functionality within the language and how best to utilize those features.The layout and examples within the book make it useful both for those who are novices in Python as well as more experienced programmers. It does a good job of catching everyone up to the same page, including a description of development environments for Python, before diving into the features in more detail. My favorite section was the chapter showing how you can use Python and C/C++ together. Those are the primary languages that I use (for both work and hobby), so it was really cool to see how the book showed tools to connect the languages together.Overall, I think this book is a solid choice if you want to really excel in your Python programming. Even if it says that it is an ""Expert"" book, it is still appropriate if you're just getting started with Python and feel comfortable with the basic syntax and semantics. It will do a fantastic job of accelerating your knowledge and experience of Python, and I know that I'll have this on hand as a reference if and when I need to develop my Python skillset further!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Expert Python Programming: Master Python learning the best coding practices and advanced programming concepts 4th Edition
"BLUF: Regardless of your experience with Python, you'll benefit from this book.PROS:- Well laid out format. Authors put thought not just into content but into presentation as well.- Chapter that gives specific examples of Python juxtaposed with other well-known (and some rather obscure) languages. As a JavaScript practitioner, I found that especially helpful.- Just enough detail. The authors don't shy away from ""going down the rabbithole"" on a particular module or two. I appreciated the section on the graphlib module (as a data analyst).- Advanced tips for both hobbiests and professionals alike. The authors' tips on development environments were excellent.CONS:- Not enough detail (in some cases). For example, the author's treatise on the poetry environment manager did not even touch other well-known ""third party"" managers (namely Anaconda). As a ""Conda"" user, a comparison between poetry and conda would have been helpful.- Too much detail (in other cases). I know this may seem contradictory given my previous statement but at times, the authors go the extra mile... and it seems a bit overkill (which may be my attention span, but there you have it).- A bit utilitarian at times. This book lacks the cutesy graphics that No Starch Press incorporates in all their books. This again is personal preference but something like that would make this book a much easier read.In conclusion, this isn't the only good ""expert"" Python book out there, but it's excellent and well worth having.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Expert Python Programming: Master Python learning the best coding practices and advanced programming concepts 4th Edition

I learned about Poetry, which I never heard of until now, and can't wait to use it on my next project. It also walks you through using Docker for development and explains why you may want to still use Vagrant in some cases even though it is an older technology.

I've read and reviewed a lot of Python books but the balance between offering enough topics to be interesting and enough depth to be valuable is tricky. This book handles it with finesse.The high points:• Leads with references instead of hiding them in the back• Starts each chapter with technical requirements• Offers PowerShell right alongside cURL• Talks about multiple virtualization options• Covers the new stuff upfront• Thoroughly goes through the complicated topics• Actually touches on deployment & observabilityThat last bit was really important to me because I feel like a lot of books will just cover the creation of the code and then what happens once it's deployed is something you learn when things start breaking. This book has earned a coveted place on my tiny bookshelf of within-reach titles while I'm writing code.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Expert Python Programming: Master Python learning the best coding practices and advanced programming concepts 4th Edition

"Meawhile I've read lots of books from O'Reilly and - frankly - all of them were great so far. This book, being the one with the most thrilling topic that I ever bought, does not convince me completely:PROS:+ The author gives very nice and concise python examples to quickly get a foot into this field.+ The structure of the book and the accompanying code snips are quite logical and understandable.CONS:- Might be a personal taste, but the author keeps citing himself again and again, which is a bit annoying and feels somewhat biased. If you search for ""Hilpisch"" throughout the book, you will surely find >100 matches, because the author VERY OBVIOUSLY likes to cite his previous books (which I haven't read)!- The book could have have twice as many pages, given the hot topic it covers. Obviously, there are other Hilpisch books that might cover these topics (thanks for the references), but for the genuine reader it would be much more valuable to explain certain concepts roughly in a few paragraphs, instead of referencing the author's other books or suggesting to lookup stuff on Wikipedia (Logistic Regression).Overall I would say the book is good but not great.

"I've read a few books from O'Reilly in that past and have generally enjoyed them. What I expected in this case was a thorough introduction to some of the core Python packages for algorithmic trading and a rundown of how the author thinks they should be integrated into a larger trading system. I was a disappointed to find only a short discussion of the capabilities of the oanda and FXCM packages and thought the authors suggested trading system to be, at times, contradictory.Also, given the wealth of prediction algorithms available in Python, I expected a more systematic review of such algorithms and some associated insights. However, only a handfull of algorithms were up for discussion and let's just say that they left a lot to the imagination. The discussion of backtesting was also largely simplified and ignored many of the real-world practicalities that have the potential to adversely affect the outcome.The lack of quality editing is glaringly obvious. The structure of the chapters changes around quite frequently. Some have an introduction, some don't. Some have discussions after testing concepts, some dont. And some are mainly just code and output. Also, many figures are illegible and typos are quite common. The overall feel is that the author either lost interest or the book became increasingly rushed as time went on.If you want a superficial overview of some up to date technologies with code that you can blindly copy then get this book.

"As CTO of a software company I co-founded, I'm not only looking for books that help me improve individually, but also books that the whole development team – from developers to architects – may find useful. Robert C. Martin’s Clean Code does both, and, like the good code described therein, it’s well written, clear, and easy to read. Martin includes many helpful examples and his suggestions are applicable to any programming language.Ideally, each developer takes charge of their own education and is constantly improving their skillset, an aspect that Martin covers in The Clean Coder. I view it as an important part of my job to help my team improve. To do so, I distill a lot of written material down to actionable components and provide that to my development team. Concepts from Clean Code have become very helpful guides for them. Below are a few of my favorite takeaways.The first is what Martin calls The Boy Scout Rule: “Leave the campground a little cleaner than you found it.” It’s a great concept, not only because it's simple to follow, but also because it has broad applicability and can be used on any project. Essentially, when a team member works on a piece of code, they should aim to improve it somehow by the time their task is finished. A few examples of this among many are: fixing an unclear variable name, breaking up a large function into smaller functions, or cleaning up a conditional for improved clarity. With everyone on the team doing this, the code improves over time and everyone feels responsible for the code whether they wrote it personally or not. Even if something can’t be addressed immediately, developers are encouraged to log the issues they see.Another of my favorite takeaways is the Three Laws of TDD, a concept I was able to quickly roll out to the team as a framework to follow for how TDD should be conducted on a project. This virtually ensures that all of your product code has test coverage. It also helps make most of your code SOLID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29), since code that is built in this fashion is structured with SOLID concepts in mind. This is a must for effective testing.Finally, the topics of proper identifier names and commenting really resonated with me and my team. In our company, we tend to “adopt” existing codebases – projects that have already been started by other developers whose code is of widely varying quality. If we're lucky, it's structured well and demonstrates best practices and approaches in how it's constructed. Unfortunately, the code is sloppy at times and requires some TLC to get it in shape. A part of that process is understanding what the existing application does. As Clean Code correctly outlines, many comments are superfluous or even plain wrong and misleading. As a team, we don’t blindly trust the accuracy of existing comments and instead go right to the application’s code to determine what it does. This is where proper naming comes into play. With good names, the code reads like comments or as a narrative of what the application does, nullifying most needs for additional commenting. Simply put, the code comments itself. We also use refactoring tools to improve names and clean up comments as we go. Of course, by doing so, we’re also applying the Boy Scout Rule.Overall, Clean Code is a wonderful book with much useful and immediately-applicable information for developers of all levels. If you're looking for a book that will help make you a better developer, this will.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
"TL;DR: even if it is not 100% correct -- few are -- do read this book. It's a really good one.I've been in the industry for 22+ years, but just started to reread this book. I consider it to be one of the top books _any_ software engineer, developer etc. should definitely read.Now, I disagree with some of things strongly. Uncle Bob is quite biased towards OOP, and in general issues presentedare more complex and I'd claim that the only rule in software engineering is ""it depends"". In general my biggest complaint is that almost all of the rules I see anyone present come with a cost, with Clean Code it sounds like they are free. Eg. I really, really like simple, short functions/methods that do only one thing, but there is a cost of adding extra levels of abstraction. Even though I do prefer that over hundreds of thousands of lines of code in one method, it doesn't come as free (even though benefits far outweighs costs, given proper execution).The other example, just to mention an example, is on naming variables. In general I agree that long, good names are much better than short cryptic ones, but for short expressions like one-line transformations are often _easier_ to read if variables are short, and their scope is limited to that one line. As an example, any experienced Python developer would immediately recognize `squares = [ n**2 for n in numbers if even(n) and n > 10]` while using longer names would just make general form (where var names don't matter). Many guides nowadays describe this principle as ""variable name length should be in relation to scope of the variable"" which is a good rule, though I believe even that has exceptions.But having said that, I'd claim things would be in much, much better condition in software industry if people read this book. And definitely he has much more impressive track record than me, so I'm ready to accept that while I disagree with some of the things, I could very well be wrong (and still blind to it). SOLID principles are really good to understand, and the first one of those applies to _everything_, even if you use functional programming paradigm.  Same goes for comments; comments are eventual lies, and developer should restrict IMO those to explaining _why_, not _what_.I read the book first time when I had been 5+ years in the industry or so, and it definitely made me a better developer. And while I now see rationale behind the rules in the book a bit lacking given complexity and variance in common problems developers face (mainly every solution has a cost), I still consider the book one of the best ones. Just get it and read it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
"As part of our learning activities, we learn quite a few programming languages.  We also learn designs, patterns, good coding practices, and many more.  We don't usually spend time to learn how to write a good, readable code.  The relevance of this book is enormous.  Not just the programmers should read it, the education providers should also read it.  In fact, the education providers should plan to include this in their curriculum associated with every programming languages.I started reading this book and finished it in almost three consecutive sittings.  That way, the book is well structured, and the topics are well sequenced.  The author cautioned at the beginning of the book that it is not for the armchair readers.  The reader should spend adequate effort to read through the code examples, think through those, and try out some of those through self scribbling.  This is indeed necessary for the coders.  This is also necessary for the instructors of coding, or programming languages.  I chose to skim through the examples with just enough thinking while paying attention to every detail of the English text.  Such speed reading worked for me too.  Such reading technique should work for all who are not into direct coding today, but was a programmer once upon a time, and spends a lot of time in conversing with the programmers nowadays.Coming back to the content of the book - this was quite informative and thought provoking.  I read it fully and tried to jot down my takeaways from this book reading.  I have got six of them.I learned the general rules for commenting, and summarized those in four points.  I learned the general rules for code formatting, and summarized those in four points.  I learned the general practice of code size - for a significant system, for a code file, for a typical function.  I learned the general rules of organizing concepts and variables, and summarized those in five points.  In fact, the definition of concepts was itself was a new learning for me.  I learned the three laws of test driven development, rather I re-learned those once more while reading this book.  Finally, I jotted down the final takeaway - leave the code cleaner than what you had started with.The book is full of good references, in fact at the end of every chapter.  I tried to summarize the list of further readings, and I got another five book titles listed in my to-read list.  I read it on my Kindle device, and on my desktop using Amazon Cloud Reader - the formatting was good.As coders, we all have the responsibility to leave the code cleaner than what we start with.  As code reviewers, we all have the responsibility to comment on the cleanliness of the codes.  As the supervisor or manager of coders, we all have the responsibility to communicate the importance of clean coding and to encourage coders towards clean coding.  I will recommend to all these group of people to read this book, and practice the clean coding techniques described here.Good work indeed!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship

"For the past few years I began to doubt whether my understanding of the craft was even correct anymore. So many code examples in so called expert books are untestable procedural junk I couldn't imagine what had happened. Design patterns and unit testing seem to have lost their place in the world. Servlet and JSP books have always been crap that way but now books on SOA and the like technologies are that kind of junk code.It was refreshing to find a book that emphasized the craft of coding - tests, reusability, comments, logging, decoupling, dependency injection, small methods, design patterns and so on. These aren't rocket science and they should be second nature to developers by now.I breathed a sigh of relief when I read this book.Having said that there are a few problems with the book. The author mixes programming paradigm terms too promiscuously. For example, he makes extensive use of Java code and continuously refers to ""functions"" and ""modules"". In a book about clean code that should be cleaned up.The author shows a misunderstanding of JavaBeans and really should rewrite his somewhat snarky comments. His example of a JavaBean, for example, shows a list of Strings being passed in on the constructor and the class has no setters. A JavaBean by definition must have a no-arg constructor. His example had no setters (which is OK for non-mutatable fields). If that was the intent, however, the fields should have been final. Did he mean POJO? He puts this in a chapter on DTOs wherein he talks about data structures. I don't know how many times the fact that I was using a getter/setter saved me grief when compared to using an exposed field. Changing the internal field type based on some new requirement is a good example of how it can help. While the setter may initially look like little more than a pass through method for the ""OO purists"" -- bah, humbug -- it can end up saving rework of a large number of classes. It allows for overloading the setter for handling new types if the requirements change. If error conditions are determined that can be detected at the setter or getter level, the fact that one has the data structure wrapped has just saved a lot of headache. The distinction made between data structure and object in this sense is specious. These JavaBeans are generally little more than protective covers for the data and do little more than set/get the data. That all appears superfluous until it bites you. The very fact that they permit further modification to meet on-going challenges during coding shows why they are used instead of hanging fields out publicly and why they are more than just data structures in drag.Perhaps he should also look at the event properties mechanism that is available for use with JavaBeans as well. There certainly are valid criticisms of JavaBeans, unfortunately the book misses them by a long way.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship

"I first met Bob Martin 15 years ago by reading his brilliantly lucid _Designing Object Oriented C++ Applications Using The Booch Method_.  He was kind enough to help me sort out my own struggles with the writings of the ""Three Amigos"" and I've been something of a fan ever since.He followed with a number of excellent books; took the lead first on Patterns and then on Agile development; but now he has reached beyond his dedicated audience of serious software architecture geeks, with this extraordinary work on writing code well.This book ranks on any shelf that has either  Code Complete by Steve McConne or Refactoring by Martin Fowler; both classics (though loyalty and enjoyment causes me to add Why Software Sucks by David Platt as belonging on that shelf as well).It is true that seasoned developers will find that they ""already know"" much of what is in the early portion of the book -- but my experience is that Martin has a unique ability to crystalize even common wisdom in a way that gives accepted practice new impetus and that expands my understanding of the implications of tenets I hold to but don't always fully implement.Bob Martin is known to many of us as ""Uncle Bob,"" and with good reason; his writing is avuncular in the finest sense of being solid advice offered in good cheer and without condescension.All of that said, this is not a light weight book; while offering up the fundamental principles that separate yeoman programmers from the truly expert, he goes on to teach more (and more effectively) about test driven development in one chapter than most authors accomplish in a book. He does the same for refactoring and, I would argue, on the way he offers a brilliant introduction to Agile programming.While we're at it, let's note that the chapters on naming and on comments would serve well as a standard for any software development group and should certainly be required reading for all new developers.In short, this book is recommended without reservation to those who are not yet convinced they know all that can be known about creating great software.

"What is clean code you might ask? One of the definitions that most resonated with me is that of Grady Booch, author of Object Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications: ""Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer's intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.""The main premise of the book, as stated by the author, is: ""learning code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. You must watch others practice it and fail. You must see them stumble and retrace their steps. You must see them agonize over decisions and see the price they pay for making those decisions the wrong way.""The book is made up of three sections: The first one outlines the ""principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code"". This includes topics such as naming, functions, comments, formatting etc. The second one, includes several working examples of code cleanup using the tools from the first section. The last section, includes a number of heuristics and smells that help identify the need for cleaning code. These smells are divided by area, such as environment, names, comments etc.What sets this book apart is the applicability, practicality and breadth of the concepts discussed. The last section of the book is of particular relevance as a starting point for identifying weaknesses or deficiencies in code. These then serve as a testing ground for applying the concepts introduced in the book. What the author stresses throughout his work, is the need to continuous practice and to clean the code in an iterative manner.A recommended read for anyone involved with the software development lifecycle regardless of experience. From a critical standpoint, the choice of some of the case study code bases was at times questionable given its abstraction. This made them hard to follow at times.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
"This is a critical thinkers book. It gives the reader a basis to use within their own programming style and language of choice.The code examples are written in Java and are there to show how to refactor code based on the principles and reasoning within the book.This is not a book that I take as a specific do this or else, more of a guide that explains why you should consider writing code in the way described.Essentially the lesson is to create code that is small, has a specific purpose and does that one thing.When functions or methods begin to stray into doing multiple things spin those code pieces off on their own and repeat.What I get from this book is a mindset or way of thinking about programming. To create code that is cohesive, is small, does not have unnecessary parts. When these principles are broken find a way to refactor or eliminate the additional pieces. It is not just about taking away or keeping code small but adopting a way of thinking about the design of the program and how each piece interacts with the other parts.The suggested line lengths of functions mentioned and other very specific examples is more where your critical thinking comes into play. I do not program in Java so many of the language specific scenarios do not apply to me. in some languages you just can't have or do some of the things suggested. Though as a general rule of thumb I find the examples helpful and when I mean general rule of thumb I do not mean a specific line count or size but a simplistic do as little as possible to achieve the goal. Simplify. Simplify. Simplify.I purchased and received the 16th printing of this book, published February 2016.There are no weird formatting or printing issues with the book as others have mentioned.If you have the ability to reason and think critically, being able to adapt examples and suggestions to your own style and language then I highly recommend this book. The contents are NOT common sense and do not come naturally to the uninitiated. The book does take you by the hand in a certain way leading you from the process of just make the program work to thinking about the logic design and function of your programs.When you are in situations where redesign is not possible the principles learned from this book will help you to refactor when possible and write new code that is better, smaller, tighter.

"Serious Python is an interesting book. Let’s tart with chapter 1, which is about starting your project. This chapter covers the dos and don’ts of laying out your code project. You learn about version numbering and automated checks. Each chapter ends with an interview with someone in the Python community. For chapter 1, the interview is with Joshua Harlow.Chapter 2 digs into modules, libraries and frameworks. Here you get an overview of how Python’s import system works. The author spends a couple of pages listing out useful standard libraries and also talks about using external libraries too. He even mentions safety practices when downloading from external resources and you learn about pip.For chapter 3, you learn about writing good documentation and API with Sphinx. This chapter focuses almost exclusively on the Sphinx framework, which is what the Python team uses to document Python itself. You will learn about Sphinx modules and writing your own extensions to Sphinx here.In chapter 4, the topic is timestamps and time zones. You will learn how to use Python’s datetime library as well as the super cool dateutil module, which is an external module for Python. The author also spends some time talking about serializing datetime objects and solving ambiguous times.The topic of distributing your software is front and center in chapter 5. Here you will learn about using setup.py, setup.cfg and the wheel format. You will also discover how entry points work!For chapter 6, you will dig into unit testing with Python’s unittest module. Julien cover regular unittest as well as mocks and then gets into how to use the tox automation project.If you have been interested in decorators, static methods or class methods, then chapter 7 is for you. The entire chapter is devoted to these types of code constructs and goes one to talk about abstract methods too!In chapter 8, Julien teaches the reader how useful Python is for doing functional programming. He focuses on generators, list comprehensions and Python’s builtins, such as map(), filter() and enumerate() among others.The abstract syntax tree is the topic of choice for chapter 9. You will learn how to writing a program using AST as well as Hy, which is a dialect of Lisp that is embedded in Python. You can learn more about that project here. There is also a section about extending flake8 with AST.For chapter 10, you will learn about performance and optimization. Here the author uses Python’s cProfile and the dis module to understand the behavior of your programs. The rest of the chapter covers various optimization techniques, such as using memoization, PyPy, buffers, etc.In chapter 11, you will learn about scaling and architecture. The title of the chapter is a bit opaque in my opinion, as the actual topic is concurrency. Here you learn about Python threads, processes and asyncio. He also talks a little about ZeroMQ.If you happen to be interesting in learning how Python works with relational databases, then you’ll want to check out chapter 12. Here the author talks about various database backends and shows an example of using Flask with PostgreSQL.Finally in chapter 13, Julien covers using the six module to support writing your code for both Python 2 and 3. He also covers single dispatch and context managers in this chapter and then wraps it up by talking about the attrs package.While some of topics that are covered seem pretty obvious, I don’t actually see very many authors or bloggers talking about them all that often. For example, I only hear about scaling on rare occasions and even concurrency articles don’t come out all that often. The only real fault I can think of here is that I might have arranged the chapters in a slightly different order than the way they ended up. I would give the book a chance and check it out if you’d like to learn more about any of the above topics!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Serious Python: Black-Belt Advice on Deployment Scalability Testing and More
"Serious Python by Julien Danjou is an excellent book for those who have gone through the ""hello world"" tutorials or those coming to Python from other programming languages, and want a book that teaches you not just how to write code, but how to write code the pythonic way.You won't find chapters on mere syntax in this book: it expects that you've already covered the basics and want to move your Python skills to the next level. This covers a lot of ground that other Python books don't, and I'm glad I have it on my digital bookshelf.Chapter 1 covers laying out the files and folders for your Python project. This chapter was great, even for an experienced software developer like myself. I always threw everything into ""src"" and ""docs"" folders, but didn't quite understand how Python projects were formatted and, more importantly, why. And while I had heard about semantic versioning before, this book pointed out a couple things that I've been doing wrong with my version numbering for my entire career.Chapter 2 covers modules and importing, which is especially helpful from other languages that have similar, but distinct, ways of importing code.Chapter 3 covers not just documentation, but Python-specific documentation: the Sphinx tool, ReStructured Text, Sphinx extensions like autodoc and autosummary, and the warnings module. These are things I had been ignorant about for years while I was writing Python code, and it's great to find all this information in one place.Chapter 4 covers timestamps and time zones, and this is not just important Python information, but important programming information. Most programmers only learn about basic time/date-related functions and stop there. Time zones and the Olsen database and how to *properly* handle them are often ignored, resulting in subtle and hard-to-debug problems in software. Chapter 4 brings all of these issues to light, along with easy-to-miss Python modules that make working with dates and timezones manageable.Chapter 5 covers packaging and distributing Python code, which is especially complex given Python's history of various and overlapping package management tools. I wish there had been more information in this chapter, but it does act as a good introduction to a topic that you'd ordinarily only find out about piecemeal over a career.Chapter 6 covers unit testing (with pytest), fixtures, and mocks. It also covers code coverage.py tool for measuring the effectiveness of your unit tests.Chapter 7 covers decorators and static/class/abstract methods. This was a great chapter for me in particular, because it's a topic that I've been getting by on by copy/pasting decorator code from other projects and, while that worked, I didn't have a full understanding of *why* the code worked until I read this chapter. The same applies  to static and class methods in Python, which are easy to misuse.Chapter 8 covers functional programming concepts. While Python isn't a functional programming language, it does have many features that support (and benefit from) writing code in a functional style. For anyone who doesn't know about functional programming, or was burned before when trying to learn the topic, this is a must-read chapter.Chapter 9 is the only chapter that I feel like isn't absolutely required reading. It's nice to have a chapter on abstract syntax trees (especially since Python comes with the ast module to help navigate Python code), but it isn't relevant to most programmers. Still, I'd rather read this chapter than try to find out about the topic from some random web tutoiral.Chapter 10 covers performance and optimization, explaining not just the cProfile module but also the dis module for disassembling Python bytecode for analysis. While this might not be directly necessary for most performance improvements, it does give a good introduction to the idea that Python bytecode isn't mystical at all; and you can directly compare how different bits of Python code are compiled to bytecode. There's also a hefty list of need-to-know, Python-specific tricks to writing faster code.Chapter 11 and 12 cover process and databases, respectively. I wish these chapters were longer, but like many of the short sections, they provide a good introduction to several concepts that many programmers are unaware of, so they are worth a read-through.Chapter 13 covers a few miscellaneous topics that don't quite fit in any other chapter, but I'm glad he covers them. Context managers, unicode, data classes (using the attrs module), and Python 2/3 support are definitely important to have in your Python toolbox.This book could easily have been ten times its current length, but I like that it is to the point and it does a great job guiding the reader through the most important topics that aren't always covered by other books. ""Serious Python"" is a book you need to read if you're serious about following mature processes and being a capable Python programmer. It's filled with practical information that's normally scattered across web tutorials, conference talks, and Stack Overflow posts, but has been compiled here into one an excellent book. 5 stars.(Full disclosure: I'm an author for No Starch Press, but No Starch Press didn't ask me to write this review and I purchased a copy on my own.)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Serious Python: Black-Belt Advice on Deployment Scalability Testing and More

"It may seem odd that a book devoted entirely to recursion would contain such statements as “You never need to use recursion. No programming problem requires recursion … In fact, a recursive function might be an overcomplicated solution…” Nevertheless, Al Sweigert goes on to explain the ins and outs of a programming technique you should rarely, if ever, need to use. And he does so masterfully. Recursion and recursive functions seem to many (including me) to be esoteric mysteries, understandable only to those elite few who are wired to think in a pretty unconventional way. We are taught from a young age that you can’t define a word by using that word, itself. To that idea, recursion says “watch me!”. In explaining recursion, Sweigert is careful to begin by laying important groundwork. With adequately (but not overly) detailed and approachable explanations and examples, he discusses functions, their operation and features. He spends significant time explaining the call stack, what it does, how it is structured, and how it operates, leading to a discussion of ‘stack overflow’, one of the risks of using recursion. With that out of the way, he then devotes an entire chapter to comparing recursion and iteration, demonstrating that in the vast majority of cases, recursive functions simply aren’t necessary and in some cases perform worse than their iterative counterparts. The ensuing chapters look at recursion in action, exploring several popular recursive algorithms and techniques. It is in these chapters where we begin to see where recursion is actually a good idea, where it is a good fit (and also where it is not). So, while recursion may be mostly unnecessary, it is absolutely tailor-made for certain functions. Among other things, Sweigert explores traversing tree structures and demonstrates how memoization (yes, I spelled that correctly) can improve the efficiency of some recursive functions. He provides a plethora of examples demonstrating each concept he explores. It is worth noting here that Sweigert provides code examples in both Python and JavaScript (where possible), making it a valuable resource for students of both. The book ends with several projects that build on the lessons that come before, including one that implements the very cool Droste Effect. For the beginning and intermediate programmer, which is the only demographic to which I can relate, the real value of this book lies not only in its teaching about recursion. Its value also stems from its ability to stretch you just a little bit further, to make think just a little bit differently, to give you confidence that maybe lofty concepts that seem way above your head are within reach. Any book that can achieve that while simultaneously telling you that what you’re learning is mostly unnecessary is well worth the read.--Reviewer was provided a review copy by the author",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Recursive Book of Recursion: Ace the Coding Interview with Python and JavaScript
"I encourage folks learning programming to first buy Al Sweigart’s book, “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”.  That book teaches you Python from the beginning and assumes no previous knowledge.  The book used in conjunction with his video course on Udemy, similarly named “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”, are a great way to start learning Python.His latest book, ""The Recursive Book of Recursion"", takes the reader into the more advanced subject of recursion.  Topics include the concepts of the stack, pushing in and popping out of the stack, and stack overflow.  Recursion is compared to iteration, and examples are shown where both approaches are shown and critiqued.  Cases where recursion is advantageous are presented with illustrations to enhance one’s comprehension. While not a beginner’s book, it is a good read to fill in a sufficiently complex subject. Copious Python and JavaScript recursion code are provided.  Some fun and cool demonstrations of recursion make use of turtle graphics.  Going forward, this will be my ‘go-to’ reference for recursion.  Thank you, Al Sweigart!Here’s a breakdown of what’s included (from the book):Introduction - Covers how to set up Python and JavaScript on your computer to follow along with the code examples in the rest of the book.Part 1: Understanding RecursionChapter 1: What is Recursion? - Explains recursion and how it is the natural result of the way programming languages implement functions and function calls.  This chapter also argues that recursion isn’t nearly the elegant, mystical concept many claim it is.Chapter 2: Recursion vs. Iteration – Dives into the differences (and many similarities) between recursive and iterative techniques.Chapter 3: Classic Recursion Algorithms – Covers famous recursive programs such as the Tower of Hanoi, the flood fill algorithm, and others.Chapter 4: Backtracking and Tree Traversal Algorithms – Discusses a problem for which recursion is particularly suited: traversing tree data structures, such as when solving mazes and navigating a directory.Chapter 5: Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms – Discusses how recursion is useful for splitting large problems into smaller subproblems and covers several common divide-and-conquer algorithms.Chapter 6: Permutations and Combinations – Covers recursive algorithms involving ordering and matching, as well as the common programming problems to which these techniques are applied.Chapter 7: Memoization and Dynamic Programming – Explains some simple tricks to improve code efficiency when applying recursion in the real world.Chapter 8: Tail Call Optimization – Covers tail call optimization, a common technique used to improve the performance of recursive algorithms, and how it works.Chapter 9: Drawing Fractals – Tours the intriguing art that can be programmatically produced by recursive algorithms. This chapter makes use of turtle graphics for generating its images.Part 2: ProjectsChapter 10: File Finder – Covers a project that searches through the files on your computer according to custom search parameters you provide.Chapter 11: Maze Generator – Covers a project that automatically generates mazes of any size using the recursive backtracker algorithm.Chapter 12: Sliding-Tile Solver – Covers a project that solves sliding-tile puzzles, also called 15-puzzles.Chapter 13: Fractal Art Maker – Explore a project that can produce custom fractal art of your own design.Chapter 14: Droste Maker – Explores a project that produces recursive, picture-in-picture images using the Pillow image-manipulation moduleFinally, I would also recommend another one of his earlier books, “Cracking Codes with Python”.  This is an excellent book on using Python to encrypt, decrypt, and cracking various encryption algorithms.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Recursive Book of Recursion: Ace the Coding Interview with Python and JavaScript
"I've enjoyed Al's books in the past, and I'm so glad I checked this one out too. I appreciate the structure, the tone, and the examples in this book the most.So far, the book is compassionate in its approach to a subject that many learners find intimidating, and is quick to acknowledge when and, more importantly, WHY things might be confusing (e.g. it references ""The fact that the call stack doesn't exist in source code is the main reason recursion is so confusing to beginners: recursion relies on something the programmer can't even see!"") This type of explanation and acknowledgment help new learners feel at ease.This book also has great examples in the form of both code (JavaScript and Python) and diagrams/figures. First, the text describes what is happening in an example, then you get to see the code, and then often a diagram or table that visually demonstrates exactly what is happening in the example.I also appreciate the simplicity of some the examples in the first few Chapters. The book uses common examples (Fibonacci, factorial, exponents, palindromes...) that students likely have already seen (non-recursively) in previous exposures to educational programming content. As someone who doesn't actively think about recursion day-to-day, I appreciate these examples that I can easily wrap my head around.I also appreciate the ""Further Reading"" sections, which point readers to deeper or alternative sources covering the relevant material!All in all, this is another book from Al that I think people should check out if they want to dig deeper into recursion!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Recursive Book of Recursion: Ace the Coding Interview with Python and JavaScript
"Recursion has a reputation of being hard and difficult to understand. In this book Al Sweigart takes a very practical approach to explaining why recursion can be useful and can provide us with valuable insights for computational thinking while at the same time showing that it is not always the best approach. The writing is very clear and engaging, even the recursion puns. I only followed along with the Python examples, but I think that adding a JavaScript option is a very smart choice.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Recursive Book of Recursion: Ace the Coding Interview with Python and JavaScript
"I thoroughly enjoyed working through the code samples accompanied by Al's clear and understandable explanations. There are gems of advice sprinkled throughout the entire book.The first couple of chapters provides a very clear explanation of recursion and a good comparison of recursion vs. iteration. Understanding is furthered by knowing any recursive algorithm can be performed iteratively using a loop and a stack. Guidance is provided about when and when not to use recursion, and what three features of a programming problem, when pres­ent, make it especially suitable to a recursive approach.Three key questions are answered for each recursive code sample: What is the base case? What argument is passed to the recursive function call? How does this argument become closer to the base case?Other parts I thoroughly enjoyed:- Seeing how a perfect maze can be represented by graph (DAG)- Quicksort walk-through (Perhaps the best explanation I've ever seen of this classic algorithm.)- Karatsuba Multiplication algorithm and also the supporting math- Introductory set theory refresher- What it means for a function to be ""pure""- Memoization and why only pure functions should be memoized- How tail call optimization worksLarger projects follow that provide more opportunities to work through code and see how recursion can be used to succinctly and elegantly implement solutions.

"As a full-stack developer in the LIS (Library and Information Science) field, Al's work has always been an important cornerstone in my coding education. Data and Systems librarians are often self-taught, and I am no exception. ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" was my Bible as I took my first steps into the field and I always recommend it to anyone who wants to follow in similar footsteps.This new title has its own place in my journey: demystifying recursion - a concept that is largely glossed over in any coding classes or bootcamps. Al handles this task with ease, thoroughly covering the gamut with his trademark accessible language, clear examples, and concise writing. For real, there's no fat to trim in this title! The result is a surprisingly easy and enjoyable read; I recommend it to anyone who wants to clear up the mystery of recursion for themselves. Don't worry about getting lost in the sauce; if you know the basics of Python or JavaScript, you'll have no problem following along.Note: I am writing this review based on a review copy provided by the author.

"I am a software developer with 40+ years experience and have worked with many different languages and environments over the years.  A new project I started working required that I use Python which I knew very little about.  I bought this book thinking that the quickest way to learn Python would be to get a concise reference and look up things I needed to know.  This has worked for me in the past in other situations.Unfortunately, this book is not what I needed.  It is not complete enough for me to learn Python little by little.  Here are some of the deficiencies I found:-  I wanted to know how to format text with parameter substitution.  Looked for ""{"" or ""}"" in the index, but they were not there.-  I saw the ""pass"" command in one of the examples and wanted to find out what it did.  It is not listed in the index, and I could not find a description of it by thumbing through the book.-  I wanted to read about the string ""replace"" function.  It is not referenced in the index.-  I wanted to find out how to determine the length of a list.  Nothing discussed about this in the section on lists.Perhaps when I learn more about Python this skimpy reference book will become useful, but for a Python beginner, I fond it sorely lacking.  After hitting a wall several times, I decided to shelve this book and get a more complete one.(By the way, I don't think Mark Lutz is a bad author.  The book I bought to replace this one was ""Learning Python"" by Mark Lutz.

I've been through quite a few, even other O'Reilly pocket references, and while they've all been helpful to some extent, I was never able to teach myself an entire language from a pocket reference. I don't think that's a thing that would work if you've never programmed before, but if you're already a programmer and you've just decided to add Python to your repertoire, skip the big book and stick this one in your desk drawer instead.

The index does not have entries for ""copy"" or ""contents"". It does have an entry for ""assignment statement"" but that will just assign an object's reference to another variable so now you have two variables pointing to the same object.

"I'm currently a college student not studying CS at the moment but needing to know a lot of the core key concepts with languages such as Python for data science and software engineering projects. I had a lot of experiences with online courses such as those on Udemy, Coursera, and Codecademy, but I felt like all of these were very lacking when it came to the support and resources behind these courses. As a college student trying to teach myself while observing my CS friends, I realized that the most important difference between taking college classes and self-studying is the community and on-demand support that books lack. Fortunately, a book like this has a whole community behind it and the support I have gotten is amazing! On top of not having to worry about grades for my classes, I can actually focus on learning Python without having to think about what assignments I need to allocate my efforts to.  I found the supplementary Udemy course very helpful in verabilizing the key concepts of each chapter and this has helped me learn and focus on the right concepts.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Automate the Boring Stuff with Python 2nd Edition: Practical Programming for Total Beginners
"I'm a non-programmer who played with BASIC back in the TRS-80 days.  So, with my limited knowledge of computer logic, I found Python very easy to learn.  I downloaded a Kindle sample to spend some time with Python to see if I wanted to go ""all-in.""What drove me nuts for the first few days was that the Kindle doesn't show the program layouts as clearly as the author's website.  I was getting a lot of programming errors for having improper indentation.  Viewing the code on the author's website straightened me out.  It also convinced me to buy the paper version of the book, instead of the Kindle version.

"I have six books from this company now, three on Linux and three on Python. All are excellent additions to any library. The material they present continues to be easy to understand with every new book I buy from them. Coding is NOT easy, there's a lot of stuff to learn and tons that you've got to commit to memory. These books make the process enjoyable, and they use practical examples that make it a lot easier to understand things like the flow of logic within statements.Allow me to give a little context: I started with computers in the 80's when I was a kid. BASIC was all I had access to, fun, but not a great start. My first PC came along and I learned DOS, despite the mostly crappy documentation. Linux came along at the end of the 90's and, while it was a great OS back then, documentation held it back on the desktop. Best I could do was get it to boot, so Windows was the only choice for a couple decades.Flash forward to the present, and I've ditched Windows completely, picked up a couple books (I don't yet own a book on Linux NOT published by No Starch) and I do better now with Linux than I ever did with Windows. Linux documentation quality is also light-years beyond what it was in the 90's, too. I spent a month on Mint and went straight to Arch.

"This book is intended for beginners, and really breaks down python in a very approachable manner. Despite that being said, I wouldn't recommend this book to a beginner. In the preface, the author mentions that this book uses many bad habits (or at the very least frowned upon habits), which is true. Many of coding examples are inefficient (which, to the author's credit, he acknowledges), and while the code might run, it's not going to be pretty. The projects look worthwhile, and those alone would be what I'd argue makes the book worth it. Many novice developers (as well as intermediate & advanced) can shrug off the idiosyncrasies that are presented in this book, but a person brand new to coding would likely misunderstand the material, ultimately leading to bad habits that'll be harder to unlearn.For a true beginner, I'd recommend the Python Crash Course book by the same publisher (No Starch Press). The fundamentals are clearly presented, and easy to understand. The foundation developed will be stronger, and you'll be less likely to develop bad habits, since most of the material is presented in a manner consistent with the python community (PEP).For example, the way variables and input functions are utilized between the two books are drastically different. In this book, user input and assignment is handled as follows:print('What's your name?')name = input()This is inefficient, and somewhat confusing, given that the alternative (as presented in Python Crash Course) is easier. In Python Crash Course, the same outcome is presented as follows:name = input(""What is your name? "")The print statement asking for the user's name is excessive.

"I am working through this book and haven't finished it yet.  I am a long term programmer having programmed for pay in Fortran for multiple jobs.  I have been programming for over 30 years and learning an object oriented language requires a shift in perspective.  So, I need little in algorithm development but details on the language features is important and capabilities to do the things that were simple in other languages is important to know how to do it in Python.  This book is very complementary to the book Think Python, IMHO.I am working in Data Science and Machine Learning in particular and found that my ability to program in Python was lacking.  So far this book has done a very good job familiarizing me with how to do certain critical things in Python.  For Data Science having a section on web site data scraping is very important.  I could just look how to do this.  Also the data structures are much richer and varied. In Fortran you created any complexity in data structure yourself.

The premise is that you've never programmed before and you're looking for some life shortcuts that you can do using the Python language. Here's the thing.

To be fair, Python is an absolutely vast subject to cover, and decisions have to be made in any introduction as to what to even mention, never mind address in any depth. This book does cover most of the items I would expect, but it is weak in some areas in my view. The object oriented programming chapter is terse, and doesn't even mention abstract classes as I recall. Coverage of lambda functions, first-class functions, closures and decorators (which some may consider intermediate topics) could be greatly improved. Solid working knowledge of these subject matters is needed in my view to be able to digest most ""serious"" code. Quite honestly, however, no introductory Python book I have purchased is what I would call stellar as a standalone volume, and I have had to piece together my working knowledge from various books and online courses.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages
Lubanovic is easy to read after going through a crash course in python. I really recommend pairing this book with: A Smarter Way to Learn Python by Mark Meyers.

Lubanovic goes further in-depth but he can be overwhelming at times especially if you do not have any prior experience with python.

This gives me the frame of reference I need without diving into all of the mathematical reasoning and overly technical explanations in my textbooks. Also, it covers a very wide range of tests - more tests than I learned in my stats classes - and gives me the foundation to go and learn more about these tests and how to use them in my stats software.

"I am still plowing thru this book to meet my goal to get a comprehensive, conceptual understanding of statistical concepts and related math, not an ability to ""do"" statistics in the mathematical sense. The beginning sections were easy to understand and I was eager to keep going. Unfortunately, the author's text and graphs for the (much more complicated) topics presented in Section 3, Distributions and the Central Limit Theorem, were not up to her earlier clear style. I had to resort to internet research in order to understand the mathematical concept, and notation, for combination possibilities. Then, I was lucky to land on a very good site for a clear description explaining ""sampling"" vs ""taking samples"". In some of the author's text, I could not tell which she was talking about. By far, my biggest gripe is omission of an explicit Y-axis in graphs. For most there is no Y-axis. For one, the Y-axis is ""density"", a term not in the index. Based on what I learned from the internet, the density technique of graphing is important enough to merit explanation. Without understanding the Y-axis of a graph, it is impossible to form a sentence ""for this x  we can state this y"".Overall, I am pleased with this book, and will finish it but at a much slower rate due to much re-reading over and over, and then ultimately giving up to go to the internet.

Probability and Statistics with Applications: A Problem Solving Text (ACTEX Academic Series)
.However, this text presents several problems that are much larger and more difficult to overcome. I've been involved in many manufacturing facilities for the past 15 years. There has been an enormous amount of great work done in statistics to help companies improve their processes and results. None of that material is covered in this text at all. It's as if the advances of the last two decades in the private sector never happened.Even worse, many of the problems describe situations that would not work in the real world. For example, problem 7.45 describes a workplace where the average worker makes $7.00/hour, and a standard deviation of $0.50. The problem further describes 64 workers ""of a certain ethnic group"" who have an average wage of $6.90/hour. This work situation is illegal on several points, such as paying below the minimum wage, and violations of the FLSA. The text does not teach responsible decision making. The only point of this problem is that there is a 5.48% chance that the pay of the ""certain ethnic group"" is less than overall workers, and does NOT teach the responsibilities and consequences of the data in the real world. Another example (and there are many more) is 7.72. A machine in a factory is shut down if a random sample of 100 items revels at least 15% defectives. Wrong. In the real world, a line is shut down when they encounter one defective. The problems are addressed and the line is then reactivated. Virtually every problem dealing with manufacturing describes situations that do not exist in the real world, and/or situations that would possibly get someone in trouble on the job because the conclusions are wrong.  It's shocking to me to realize that in this book the math in the problems can be flawless but the conclusions dead wrong in the real world.The only inference I can make (pending any correction) is that the authors have little or no real world experience actually using statistics. It seems that they have not been in a situation where they have skin in the game - where their name is on the line and there are real consequences to their decisions and recommendations. It also appears that what experience they do have is so long ago that the world has passed them by in its many advances, whether it is the uses of statistics as applied to modern business intelligence or data mining or six sigma or lean manufacturing or data modeling and analysis, game theory, chaos theory, economics, biostatistics, bioinformatics, quality control, risk management, signal processing, insurance, meteorology and much more - I did not find virtually any real world examples of any of these in this book. The missed opportunity here to use examples of how statistics is used in the real world and how to use statistics in real world decision making puts students using this book at a huge disadvantage compared to other books.There are much better books out there. Probably the best to learn the basics of probability is

"We bought the kindle version for my daughter.  She is taking this as an online class, but they are having problems getting her a copy of the book, so we found this instead.  The first issue we encountered was when she was trying to do assigned homework problems in section 1.2 of the book.  Section 1.2 problems go all the way up to problem #86, but when she looks at the problems, they only went up to 73.  The next time she looked, they went up to 82, the next time it was 71.  We couldn't figure out what was happening.  After looking at it some more, it turns out that the problems in the book keep getting renumbered, which means she has no idea which problems she is supposed to do for her assignment.  We tried this on the kindle app for a Mac, her iPhone, and on a PC.  The problem persisted on all the different operating systems, so this is definitely an issue for the publisher and/or the kindle app, but I see no way to fix it and have no idea who to call for help.  It also appears to be an issue with other sections of the book, so it's pretty much worthless at this point.",1.0 out of 5 stars,UPDATED Version of The Practice of Statistics
"This is one of a handful of books on ML and R, and it’s by far the simplest in its coverage of content. For instance, it’s the only one I’ve looked at so far that has explained the difference between the Naive Bayes and Exact Bayes algorithms, although I haven’t looked at the Manning books on ML (e.g., Practical Data Science with R) some of which use R and some Python (e.g., Real-World Machine Learning). By a kindergarten approach to ML, I don’t mean to be disrespectful or to minimize the contribution of the book—presenting a topic at a simple basic level is worthwhile. The reasons I downgraded the book slightly were the large number of errors in the book (which look like material from previous editions that wasn’t caught) and some carelessness in what is presented. For some reason, in the chapter entitled “Overview of the Data Mining Process,” it bothered me a lot that the authors detail creation of dummy variables but don’t present factor variables until halfway through the book. Perhaps that was just the desire to present things at a basic level, however. I did learn some R functions I wasn’t familiar with from this book, and it does provide clear, explicit explanations of ML (or data mining) techniques. (For the life of me, I still don’t have a clear understanding of the differences between ML, data science, data analytics, and data mining—I suspect it is how the techniques and data are used that determines the difference, because the same techniques are used in all of these disciplines.) Hope this review was useful.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mining for Business Analytics: Concepts Techniques and Applications in R
"There are a lot of good things about this new book. First, this is a very good authoring team. They have a deep (both correct and very  up-to-date) understanding that spans the technical aspects of data analytics, and how and why analytics is used in business settings to make business oriented decisions. Second, the book is well crafted. It is very well organized with very clear and to-the-point explanations. Of the five authors of this book, three of them (Shmueli, Bruce and Patel) have been together as a text writing team since 2007, and this is the 5th time they have updated and revised their business analytics text based on new developments in the field, and based on ongoing feedback from faculty and students who have used the text in both academic courses and professional training courses. Third, because this team has been deeply involved in data analytics for decades, they have a good sense of perspective. They understand the history and evolution of models from the statistics community, as well as the history and evolution of models from computing communities spanning both data mining and machine learning. The lead author, Galit Shmueli, has been publishing in both the statistics literature as well as the management science literature on the differences between explanation (and inference) versus prediction. This depth of perspective, and technically correct understanding of these important nuances, are reflected in how the material in this book is organized and presented. Fourth, they provide a unified and coherent approach to understanding these models.  They have major sections on classification models and prediction models. They also have sections on time series forecasting, association models, and clustering. In each of these sections on model and application specifics, they draw on the appropriate models from across the communities of statistics, data mining and machine learning. In addition, the book contains sections on the front end (data prep, exploration, and dimension reduction), as well as on the backend of the modelling process (model evaluation). All examples are worked out in R.The specific chapters on each data analytics modeling method are relatively short and to-the-point, as there are numerous textbooks and professional books on every one of the individual methods covered in this text. Because these authors are now in their fifth iteration of the content, and because they get a lot of feedback on what users of this material do and do not clearly understand, this authoring team has a knack for adding special explanatory material for those things that people tend to not understand well, or often misunderstand. While the chapters on each method are by design brief and introductory, they are solidly sufficient and highly informative, even for people with prior background in these methods. They have a good way of knowing what is important to explain, and a good way of explaining what they present.In short, this is an excellent introductory text and also serves as a very good reference text for the most up-to-date thinking on the the modeling that underpins  business analytics.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mining for Business Analytics: Concepts Techniques and Applications in R

"As a math teacher for 25 years, I have seen a lot of books that attempt to explain introductory statistics.  This new book by veteran teacher and math writer Pat Honner is the best book I have seen of this type.  What is so great about this book is that Honner takes a topic like statistics that can be very dry with many formulas and he weaves a story about the power and limitations of different statistical techniques.  Beginning with simple statistics in the early chapters that could be read by even middle school students, this book progresses until, by the end, it would be a great book for a college student who is taking introductory statistics and wants to get the big picture and a lot of detail about solving very specific questions in statistics.  The last few chapters cover a topic that is very difficult to teach without getting bogged down in formulas, but Honner does just that.  This is a great book to be used as a resource for anyone who wants to learn statistics or who wants to supplement a bulky A.P. or college stats book with something that gets to the essence of what statistics is about while also teaching how to solve stats problems.I especially liked the last chapter about the limits of statistical reasoning, something that is sorely needed in today's news world where articles are often called 'fake news,' it is good to get the techniques to evaluate such claims for yourself.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Painless Statistics (Barrons Painless)

"I came into a class late, and was unable to get the printed textbook in time. No one in the program (believe it or not) was using a Kindle version. I had no choice, because I had assignments due.For the most part, it's really great. I mean the way the Kindle App features work. However, there are some problemsSome pictures can be zoomed and have great resolution. However others, when zoomed are illegible. Still others (like mathematical formulae) ""bounce"" back to the left margin. So I use pinch-zoom, but as soon as I let my fingers off, the formula flies off to the left margin. If it's a long formula, I can see the right-most part of it. Most of the short formulae, however, simply disappear.I needed to use the Standard Distribution Table at the beginning of the Appendix, in order to answer one of the self-test questions. Well, it was an extraordinarily tall, skinny, table. Zooming it left me with a bunch of muck, that was totally illegible.While I like the features of the Kindle book generally (links, and quick movements, exporting cards, highlights, and notes, etc) some of these other issues may force me to order the paperback copy as a ""companion"" so that I can have full access to formulae and tables.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Discovering Statistics Using IBM SPSS Statistics: North American Edition

You will not get extended stories to teach you the materials but you will get clear explanations and some nice mnemonics to help you remember the vocabulary.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Clinical Biostatistics and Epidemiology Made Ridiculously Simple: An Incredibly Easy Way to Learn for Medical Nursing PA Students And Other Healthcare Professionals (MedMaster Medical Books)
"This book is wonderful. Without it I would not have passed biostatistics I. I don't even read my course textbook, I relied completely on this book and scored a ""B"" on my final. Several of my classmates also purchased this book and feel the same way as I do. Our course director is actually going to incorporate this book into the course next year. It is a short read, roughly 90 pages. The nice thing about it is you can look up the topic in the index and skip around based upon what concept you are trying to understand. The authors do a phenomenal job of breaking down concepts with minimal math. I appreciate this as incorporating math makes it way more confusing.

I had taken a biostats course, but I barely understood was going on during that time as well. This book gave a simple explanation for most of the tests that were being discussed in the studies and helped me to better understand why the test was being done and what each test was used for.I recommend this book for someone who needs a really simplified explanation of biostats.

This is a great book covering all the details about statistics but you may wish to consider purchasing CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae instead. It covers most of the contents of the stats book for a few dollars more.,5.0 out of 5 stars,CRC Standard Probability and Statistics Tables and Formulae
"This reference is a good complement to a collection of standard statistics texts. Often, those texts have good explanations of their concepts. But then provide only limited tables of commonly encountered distributions. Part of this may be that to those authors, such tables let them add relatively little value. To an author, her value is in her origina musings, and not necessarily in filling the latter part of her book with reams of tables.Thus, there is a natural inclination of statistics authors to only provide a modicum of tables. The barest minimum! Well, your answer to this might be to amass several texts, so that hopefully, the tables you need can be found in one of these.An alternative is to get this book. Not a text, but a reference manual. Though the editors thoughtfully precede the tables with brief explanations of their usage and some cogent examples.

"I ADORE THIS BOOK and plan on sharing it with many of my students. Why? We want our research to be rigorous, but many of us rely on hazy knowledge gained from basic courses on introductory statistics many years ago. It can also be difficult to grasp the subtle details of when and how our techniques will be appropriate as we pursue statistically sound research.Reinhart's book helps fill that conceptual gap, and it does it extremely well with a fresh and inviting writing style. This book discusses the pitfalls of relying on statistical significance, the nuances of power analysis and why everyone should do it, and the dangers of pseudoreplication (even though so many people do it). There is a very clear discussion of the ""base rate fallacy"" which, for events that are rare anyway, can yield apparently statistically significant results (which are nowhere near significant). Furthermore, Reinhart calls out fundamental issues: for example, he notes that many researchers do not have a good grasp on what the p-value (which is used to definitively reject null hypotheses... or not) represents. It also describes regression to the mean, a phenomenon that arises often in claims of firms or processes that outperform others.This is an amazing book that can help everyone become a more aware consumer of statistical claims, as well as a more rigorous researcher. It is a short, clear, and easy read, accessible to anyone with an algebra background. The last two chapters provide some actionable advice for improving your own practice as a researcher, and helping improve the practice of others through statistical education. Although the book is subtly disturbing (it now has me wondering how many claims in quality management aren't actually statistically significant), it contains material that every researcher in quality management should embrace.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistics Done Wrong: The Woefully Complete Guide
"This book is great!Just make sure you are not new to statistics. If you start with this book, you will learn nothing useful, only some tidbits here and there, mostly unconnected.This book will tell you only about p values and power of a test. Some 90% of the contents of this book are related to what people does wrong with regards to p values, which is a lot, I have to say.I had no idea of the current status of many science topics and this book sadly illustrates about it. You will learn that many doctors, scientists and even reviewers have no idea about what they are talking about or commenting on.You need to be confident with the use and understanding of many statistics before you get to read and understand this book. This is not a book for everyone, this is for sure. Neither is it a book about statistics. It is a book on the misuse and bad implementation of p values and how people dealing with statistics make the wrong question and get the wrong answer out of their statistics and their data sets.If you are fluent with p values and the power of the test, and you can deal with hypothesis testing and all that stuff, then go read this book and you will learn something really useful.If you are not used to statistics, this book will teach you nothing. But it is a very well written book, a nice piece of any collection. So go get it even if you cannot deal with statistics. Then, learn statistics because it is a huge investment anyway.

"You don’t have to be a statistician to understand this book. Even though it does not delve into the nitty-gritty of mathematical statistical analyses, it provides enough information for the reader to be able to ask the right questions when developing a study in collaboration with statisticians or evaluating the results of a research study. In particular, the author’s emphasis on understanding the statistical power of a data set and using of confidence intervals instead of p-values should be helpful to non-statisticians in study design and analysis.Even with the emphasis on confidence intervals, the author does not discuss the potential pitfalls of using averages in data analysis, such as presenting results that are mathematically accurate but physically impossible. For example, if a data set has regions of discontinuity, then the average surrounded by the confidence interval could be in a place where the data is discontinuous, and thus impossible. In small data sets with wide confidence intervals, the discontinuity may not even be discoverable.Overall, this book is a worthwhile read for anyone involved with study design, data analysis, or statistically-analyzed research.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Statistics Done Wrong: The Woefully Complete Guide

"A fantastically interesting book. Anyone who loves numbers, and loves science will appreciate the compiled research and examples Alex Reinhart published here. Many times, reading the stories and statistical studies, I thought back to my Ivy League university experience. Often times, a professor quoted some study based on a particular topic, described the nature of the study, and then presented the conclusion. Too many times, the conclusion struck me as nonsensical or counterintuitive. I asked several professors, ""Why did they conclude ""A"" and not ""B"" or ""C"" or even something else? None knew answers to these questions. Then, I asked them, ""Where is the data? Have you ever seen the data?"" No, they had not. One tenured professor shrugged and told me, ""You can try writing to the experimenter and asking to see it."" That blew me away. Professors at top universities believed and professed unproven conclusions they had personally never challenged.Statistics, however, was a favorite class of mine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistics Done Wrong: The Woefully Complete Guide

"The author, though titling the book ""A First Course"", wrote the text assuming the reader has already taken an introductory probability course.Very early on, the author presents examples which expects the reader to just ""reason it out"" on procedural short-cuts he took, or steps not shown; WTF, I wouldn't be reading your book if I could do that already.As an example, the first chapter is ""Combinatorial Analysis"". It was about 15 sparse pages. Really, am I expected to reach from nothing to an adequate understanding of combinatorics after just 15 sparse pages?Because that chapter did not present any general systematic approaches to solving combinatorics questions, my approach towards solving the end-of-chapter problems was to apply random combinations (lol) of the principles described in the chapter until I reached the correct answer.After grinding through the first two chapters, I stopped. Because I clearly had to study additional introductory materials first before using this book.Maybe I am using this book wrong? Maybe this does not work as a fully self-contained book for learning on my own? Maybe I have a negative IQ?

It shows that the authors are also top researchers in the field. The theorems, examples, and exercises are chosen with a purpose. They know what's important to make advances in modern probability and what's old-fashioned. They are building a solid foundation on which students can develop more advanced probability.2. Rigor. Theorems and proofs are presented with adequate rigor. They explain as much as possible and present possible pitfalls (such as measure theoretic details) and hint at how to solve them.3. Probabilistic ideas. The proofs are presented with probabilistic ideas. I suspect this is the primary reason why some students find it difficult. They have never been exposed to probabilistic way of thinking. But this is what the textbook is supposed to train them. And it does it flawlessly.4. Statistical ideas.

Although I love math, it does not come easy to me and so I really take professor's advice to ""actually read"" the textbook.I have never so consistently felt like I read a section of a book and got nothing out of it. Every time I read the book I pay careful attention to what is being said, and try and determine how formulas are produced. However, the language in this book is very poor; I can't help but conclude that the people who wrote this book are good mathematicians but horrible writers. The book seems to have an obsession with brevity, resulting in the authors using as little words as possible to explain concepts and giving no explanation on how the examples are approached beyond what is absolutely necessary. This all results in sections being very short, but who cares if a section is short if its content is worthless?You will not feel prepared to do the problems of a section after reading it, you will very likely have to almost entirely supplement your usage of this book with outside sources to understand how to solve probability problems, so much so that I recommend not using at all, and avoiding its confusing, overly brief language altogether.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Probability (Cambridge Mathematical Textbooks)

How much would it hurt to include few lines explaining what the formulas/distributions... are used for? The only redeeming feature about the textbook are the examples. At least those won't make you go insane. While reading this text, I would often get images of the authors patting themselves on their head for writing such technical book that demonstrate their mathematical efficiency.

For anyone looking for an introductory book on probability and statistics this one is your best option! My only complaint about this book is the section on transformations was lacking. Transformations is probably one of the hardest topics in statistics and the author really blew through this section without enough explanation or examples. Other than that this is a very well written text.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications An
"I am surprised by the number of negative reviews for what I consider to be a nicely written, well thought out, and logically presented introductory course on mathematical statistics. Yes, a working knowledge of elementary calculus is a prerequisite. But the mathematics invoked in the exposition of concepts and theorems are kept as simple as possible while maintaining that modest level of rigor appropriate for a introductory exposition. If you do not have the minimal mathematical prerequisites (such as freshman calculus), blame your instructor or your school  for selecting an inappropriate text. But don't blame the authors! I thought the examples and problems were appropriate in their level of difficulty (mostly not so hard) and the relation to the material just covered. There are plenty of poorly written, impossibly dry, inpenetrable texts on statistics out there - this is not one of them. In addition, the book is attractively packaged, the paper quality is excellent, the visuals are informative and clearly presented - that also should not be taken for granted. Lastly the authors have a wicked entertaining sense of humor that spice the presentation throughout.  I consider this book to be a welcome addition to the set of modern textbooks available to the curious serious student of probability and statistics.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications An
"This is great book for someone with a background on mathematics and statistics who wants to deepen their knowledge on the history on the development of statistics as a scientific field. There a many real world examples and useful discussions on how statistics and probability can become helpful in answering business questions.If you don’t have a good background in mathematics, this book may not be for you. I would say a recent exposure to calculus and multivariate calculus is needed to feel comfortable with the book and be able to enjoy it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications An
"Very disappointed with the overall quality of the book. The binding is 'eh' at best. The pages are thin.The printing... The printing is terrible. Completely black and white (the material is dry enough as it is). It would not be hard to add a little color (the chapter titles, headers, etc) and it would go a long way. The print job looks like they used a 40 year old dying printer. Little splotches everywhere. Text looks fuzzy in places.The fact that I have to pay $170 for a book of very low quality is sad.

"EDIT: After using this book for class, I will repeat, AVOID THIS BOOK and especially avoid XL Miner. I did like the chapter on Naive Bayes. The rest is written poorly. The worst part though is the use of Analytic Solver XLminor Excel add-on. Do not work as expected, support info is lousy, ""live chat"" is actually an email you have to wait for a reply. The book requires you to use XL minor for the problems at the end of chapters, but it seems like there is always missing info, sheets, and instructions in the provided excel files. It will literally tell you to refer to sheets that do not exist in the workbook. It will then tell you to do a partition on the data to only find out your student license limits you from doing as instructed. But you can upgrade for $2000!! Stay away from this book, but even more importantly, STAY AWAY FROM ANALYTIC SOLVERS for Excel.Book is not written very clearly and some sentences make an absolute mess of syntax and require being re-read multiple times. It definitely assumes you have a firm grasp of statistical concepts and vocabulary (they will use a lot of interchangeable synonyms throughout). It's based on using XLminer which is just as much of a headache and a pain. Look in Excel add-ons for XLminer and read those reviews to get a better picture. The authors do not explain how to use XLminer very well and there are many issues when using on Excel 365 online. I'll be removing XLminer as soon as my classes are done.

"This book is aimed at students in the social sciences, education and related subjects who have only a basic background in statistics and quantitative research design.  The emphasis is on the design and execution of research projects, and includes issues of planning and sampling, measurement, choice of statistical model, and interpretation  of results.  Frequently, the topics research design, measurement and statistics tend to be covered in three separate texts and any links are left to the struggling student or novice researcher, who too often finds it difficult to integrate these.  The aim of this book is to encourage researchers to consider all the assumptions and their interactions when making decisions during the planning of research.  They need to take into account the interrelationships between 'technologies' when designing the structure of the study, creating measuring instruments, collecting data, selecting statistical tools, and interpreting the results.  Therefore, the statistical tests are not just after-the-fact, but are used as part of the planning process to help make such decisions as sample size and desired reliability of instruments.The titles of the chapters are: Part I: Introduction to Research Design 1 The Nature of Enquiry 2 Beginning the Process 3 Initial Sources of Invalidity and Confounding 4 Basic Designs 5 Identifying Populations and Samples 6 Additional Sources of Confounding by the Measurement Process and  Interactions 7 Refining the DesignsPart II: Measurement Design 8 Principles of Measurement and Collecting Factual Data 9 Measuring Attitudes, Opinions and Views 10 Measuring Achievement 11 Evaluating Data Quality: Determining Instrument Reliability and ValidityPart III: Turning Data into Information Using Statistics 12 Descriptive Statistics Using a Spreadsheet 13 Probability and Statistical Significance 14 Power of Statistical Tests  Part IV: Ex Post Facto, Experimental, and Quasi-experimental Designs:  Parametric Tests 15 Comparing Two Groups: t-test 16 One-way Analysis of Variance: ANOVA 17 Factorial Designs 18 Randomised Block Designs and Analysis of CovariancePart V: Non-Parametric Tests: Nominal and Ordinal Variables 19 Nonparametric Tests: One- and Two-Sample 20 Nonparametric Tests: Multiple- and Related-SamplesPart VI:  Describing Non-causal Relationships 21 Correlation and Association 22 Regression",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences: An Integrated Approach to Research Design Measurement and Statistics

"On first read-through, I was excited by this book. Enough so that I organized and taught a graduate seminar using it as a text. My experience with the book was less than fully satisfactory, I am sorry to say. The subject matter is important, and van der Vaart's pathway through the material is well conceived, but in the nitty-gritty details there are problems. The all-important Chapters 19-25, on asymptotics in metric spaces, suffers from wild differences in level of exposition, even within individual chapters. Some notations and concepts are left undefined. Most proofs are incomplete sketches, leaving many students confused and bewildered. It takes a lot of mathematical maturity to fully decode what van der Vaart has to say, with the result that his message is often missed or misunderstood. The supplementary notes that I felt required to write ballooned from an initial 10 pages to over 60, and I believe that other, more conscientious professors have written far more. I have no doubt that some of those ""supplementary"" collections of notes will see their way into print, as textbooks that ultimately do a far better job with this critical material.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Asymptotic Statistics (Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics Series Number 3)

"This is probably the most readable statistics book, I've read to date.  I'm sure there were many rewrites in preparing this book because the authors have taken the time to figure out how to verbally explain mathematical subjects in detail.  You have to respect their care in this regard.  That doesn't mean you won't find any sigma notations in the math.  It is real math.  They just try to avoid compounding too many formulas together and they support them well with words.This doesn't cover the breadth of stat sampling techniques, you might find in the classics by Cochran, Kish, Thompson or Lohr but what it does cover, it takes the time to explain well.  There are lot's of sidebar references to other authors and studies, which helps bring the subject to life.It's worth noting that this book is designed to serve the field of sociology, so there is a fair amount of info and discusion about field surveys, non-responses, ehtical issues in surveying, etc, which may not be of interest to the more general purpose reader.  You should plan to skip around and unlike Cochran or Kish's sampling books, this book is fully conducive to a skip-around reading style.  (If I hadn't skipped most of the stuff in the beginning, I would have found it a lot less interesting.)If you're breaking into statistical sampling, this would be a good place to start.  It's not the only book I'd own, even in the beginning, but the care they give to explaining the core principles and bringing them to life with examples is a welcome support to the other books on your shelf.  Even though they don't cover everything there are some areas where do go to some depth, and because of their clear style of writing, I'm still planning to read their description of ""roh"" and compare it with what I thought I learned from Cochran.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Survey Methodology

"This book covers the topic in meticulous detail. I've recently been tasked with creating a survey and ordered this book to self train in the topic. I also reviewed some of the academic literature in the field to get some more specialized/short pieces on the topic. This book offers fantastic coverage of the topic with clear examples of the most likely types of trouble you will encounter. The statistics is not too bad. I haven't had a statistics class but 3 semesters of calculus, 3 semesters of applied math and a semester of statistical mechanics was more than sufficient preparation. The hard part was reading the book. The writing leans towards long & dry. The equations were quite the relief from the prose. So short and to the point.However, the most important element in the survey process was left out. Politics. There isn't too much you can do when management from several levels above you, grabs hold of the process and offers a survey that fails to collect the right data, attempts make one question do the work of two or more, flat out asks the wrong question and throws in a few pointless questions for fun and giggles. Thank goodness a few of my suggested questions made it in unscathed and we have some interpretable and useful data.Some of the survey recipients are also co-workers and I was privileged to hear their opinion. They did not know which questions I'd written vs. the others. But as I named ""their"" questions vs. ""my"" questions, the questions were quickly sorted into ""pointless"" vs ""knew their stuff'.  I would like to give credit to this book and thanks to the authors for saving me from the scathing opinions flying during that meeting.And now it is up to me to draw up some conclusions and write a believable report using this mess of....data.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Survey Methodology

There are some advanced statistics discussed in here and there is an assumption that you will be somewhat literate in advanced statistics when reading.The reason I gave this book 3 stars is because the Kindle version appears to have been formatted and edited by a chimpanzee.

"I have nothing to compare this to, but I think the text certainly attains its stated goals, which is to help researches gain an insight into many useful statistical methods without knowing the theory behind it.  While I agree that I would love to have the theory presented as well, the fact of the matter is as long as you pay close attention to the limitations stated in the text, you can get by without knowing the theory for a lot of analysis if you are using a decent statistical software package.It ultimately comes down to what you need to do.  If you have a pretty good statistical program that does the calculations for you, then this book is quite useful, and in fact will allow you to apply statistical methods over a broader range, much quicker than if you learn the underlying theory and use something like Matlab to write your own calculations for the same methods.  If you are going into a profession for long term data analysis, this would be an excellent place to start because the focus is on practicality and case studies so you can see what the methods are used for (i.e. see the ""forest"" through the ""trees"").However, the next step after this book would be something deeper on the calculus derivations for regression and further exploration into stated assumptions violations such as independence and constant variance.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Statistical Sleuth: A Course in Methods of Data Analysis
"The author is clearly expert in statistical analysis. He succeeds in introducing statistics as an entity unto itself, rather than a little understood and oft-misused tool by scientists. This book is intended for serious scientific minds who want to understand the elements of statistical thought and analytics. Chapters utilize published scientific papers to explore statistical concepts and teach appropriate applications. It is here, unfortunately, that the book falls quite short. In treating statistics as the science it is, the author presumes too much on the part of the student. It is akin to a beginning cell biology student sitting through a series of advanced molecular genetics seminars. The explanations of many concepts presume too much fundamental knowledge or provide insufficient detail to be able to follow the essential thought processes. The organization of the book is also problematic, one chapter does not always follow from the one preceding it. Each chapter is accompanied by 25 - 35 practical exercises, and data sets are available for download to use with these exercises. In addition there are approximately a dozen quiz questions per chapter. Unfortunately, solutions are not available for the exercises, only answers for the quiz questions.

"This has all the probability (set theory, distributions, etc) and statistics (both descriptive and inferential) that you would need to get started in a data science context.I say this because that's exactly what I bought the book for, and it served that role well!To get the most out of this book, I would do the problems listed in the book, and also write down the formula(s) and steps for solving them. Most of the later chapters depend on material covered earlier in the book, so I wouldn't recommend moving on to another chapter or even section of the book until you know you can follow the steps laid out in the equations (if any).One quick tip: for things like probability distributions, you should focus more on knowing why you would use one over the other rather than try to memorize the steps by heart (because you probably won't, and don't need to).When you can successfully solve a problem using the formula or listed steps alone, you can usually move to the next section of the book.The book is useful for reference too, if it's been a while since you've done a problem type you can just review a section to review the process of pulling it off correctly. Knowing when you would use a certain technique described in the book is always more important than trying to memorize it by heart.Good for initial learning and good for review as far as undergrad-level math is concerned.

The Probability Lifesaver: All the Tools You Need to Understand Chance (Princeton Lifesaver Study Guides)",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Humongous Book of Statistics Problems (Humongous Books)
"Statistics and Calculus are probably the two most useful mathematical concepts known to man. They are used extensively not only in math, engineering, and science, but also in business, finance, and economics as well.Statistics allows one to derive relationships between data sets and derive future probabilities and, therefore, predictive abilities. If you want to predict the future within reason, then all you need are strong statistics (sometimes calculus) knowledge and plethora of accurate and relevant data.This book unleashes the power of statistics unto the reader. The explanations are the clearest I have read and the most user friendly. Unfortunately, most of the statistics books are very dry and difficult to read. This book tries to counter that trend. Although statistics is still a dry topic, the format of this book, with its many captions, tries to make it interesting. It views statistics from the reader's perspective and tries to fill in the knowledge gap a reader might have about statistics as each chapter progresses. It is very well written and I wish this was my statistics text back during my school days.There are plenty of practice problems but many of the practice problems are essentially the same problems with different wording. Much of the steps in solving the problems in each chapter involves using the same processes and formulas. The questions are also on the easy side. If you are looking for challenging statistics problems, then this book may not fill your need.This book does not involve using calculus and only arithmetic and algebra knowledge are required. But by doing so, it doesn't dig into advanced statistics which is probably beyond the scope of this book anyhow.Instructions on using statistics software such as SAS, MiniTab, or Excel are NOT included. This is pure statistics textbook that teaches how to solve problems using a good old fashioned calculator and statistics tables.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Humongous Book of Statistics Problems (Humongous Books)
"Yet another superb title from Mr. Kelley. This title covers a lot of ground in statistics, certainly all of the major topics in a (non-calculus requirement) statistics course are covered here. Much better written and much more readable than the text used in my class. Definitely aimed at a first statistics course (eg. stats for business or humanities for students that have not taken calculus yet). Teachers would do well to replace the (poorly written and expensive) textbooks with this book + practice problems.As with any of the Humongous books, the way to get the most out of this book is to tackle this with paper and pencil at hand, and work out the problems, then compare solutions.+ The second half of the book (Inferential statistics) is particularly strong. The authors explain the details behind hypothesis testing, computing confidence intervals etc very well. They don't take a ""plug this into your TI-83/84 calculator to compute a p-value"" approach. They take the longer route of lucidly explaining the computation that goes into these problems - so students working through the examples understand the process and rationale behind the computations.- I felt that the probability chapters were weaker, but in fairness, the probability + distributions topics will require a book by themselves to do justice to. Also it is hard to do much with distributions without calculus. This does not detract from the value of this book.It is a no-brainer buy at around 15 bucks.Hope Michael Kelley has more Humongous titles in the pipeline !",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Humongous Book of Statistics Problems (Humongous Books)
"The book is horribly edited. The first section says that it's the Humongous Book of Algebra Problems at the bottom. In the section on null hypotheses (chapter 10 -- the only one I tried to work through), one of the problems said A was the null hypothesis and B was the alternative hypothesis in the text, but the opposite when written out. It was very clearly shoddily edited, which was a shame. I did one page of problems and I cannot trust it. I am incapable of learning from a book that I cannot trust to give me the correct answer. Don't waste your time. I replaced it with The Probability and Statistics Outline from Schaum's and I'm happy with that.",1.0 out of 5 stars,The Humongous Book of Statistics Problems (Humongous Books)

Thank you. This book along with Statistics analysis with Excel for Dummies are two purchases which I believe will be awesome adjunct books to help me get extra practice with the material my Professor will be covering this Fall.

"This book was not around in the 80's when I went to college or I would be a statistician today. Seriously though, I developed an interest in statistics after 30 years as a software engineer. Now retired - I have time to learn and this book is a great help. With books like this you can learn this stuff on your own. I have been reading up on the history of statistics & probability - that too is an interesting study...makes learning the math more interesting. Particularly interesting was how competitive early statisticians were, how disdainfully the theoretical mathematicians look at them, and the religious war between the Frequentists and the Bayesians.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Humongous Book of Statistics Problems (Humongous Books)
"I am currently working in chapter six, although I really like the format of the book, there are a fair number of typos, about 5 that I have noted so far, including on p. 159, where they state that probability of 0.4 is greater than 0.5.  There is also a disturbing error carried throughout the book so far, in the formula for the binomial distribution (I looked it up on Wikipedia, to get the right one), although they plug the correct numbers into the problem (different than their formula).  This can be confusing.  There are also a number of statements with no explanation, like asking you to calculate the variance of a Poisson distribution, then saying it is equivalent to the mean in a Poisson distribution, without any elaboration.Overall I really like the teaching style, but looking at the errors is quite distracting and potentially frustrating.",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Humongous Book of Statistics Problems (Humongous Books)

"I found this book helpful while taking an online statistics course - it is short and concise, and quite readable. It seems aimed at teaching you to interpret statistics rather than actually Do statistics (yes, we use computers, but it is important to understand what the formulas mean - the formulas get lost in the ""For the Statistician"" sections), and I found this a bit frustrating sometimes. So, this book probably would not be super useful if you need to analyze your own data, but it's a great introduction to how health professionals typically use statistics.I think future editions would benefit from using more visual aids interspersed with the text (not just tables of data or graphs) to help consolidate important concepts. It would also be helpful to put the chapters into context and explore Why being able to give a critical assessment of data is valuable.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Statistics for Nursing: A Practical Approach: A Practical Approach

"Unfortunately my review conveys huge disappointment. Avoid this text, if you can. If you must use this text, buy used. Just make sure it's the correct edition for your particular course/instructor. Don't fall for the online support. Online learning support offered by the publisher, and for which an access code is required, is marketing B.S., and hardly helpful to the student. Remember, you can always buy the access code if you think you need to see the same content online.This text is well marketed, but weak in content. It's poorly written, proof-read and edited. The publisher has success with this text by essentially offering a canned course to instructors, making it relatively easy for them. For the student, however, it's an insult overall, and singularly unimpressive as a learning tool. This includes the author's SPSS (IBM statistics program) ""support"". Be aware that you may need to access YouTube and/or more sophisticated material to adequately and thoroughly understand these basic concepts, as presented by the author.Another demeaning aspect of this text is evidenced by sarcasm veiled in lame humor that is peppered throughout the flimsy text. Ironically, the numbers of words and the value of content contained in the ""statistician"" contributions (offered by the Heavey's epidemiologist-spouse), far exceed the author's. Elizabeth Heavey's writing style fosters confusion rather than clarity- even of simplest concepts. I don't know who this author imagines she is writing for. Examples are not illustrative, and she never offers more than one illustration or example per concept; nor does she offer any particular nursing research wisdom pertaining to any aspect of statistics she claims to teach.Online learning support includes author, word-for-word, digital audio recordings of 13 chapters. The author yawns and sighs, sirens, dogs, traffic, and general atmospheric noise drones along as she reads her chapters with zero enthusiasm. She does not read the statistician contributions, however. Too bad. Throughout the text the author constantly reminds the reader of her PhD in epidemiology and her college instructor status.This text does not represent the nursing profession well. I am embarrassed by it.The end-of-chapter assignments are worthy of note. The author's style extends to the assignments. Confusion and frustration versus clarity and discrete understanding of simple concepts.Shame on the mercenary publisher who let this text loose on the nursing education community. I'll take this experience into account when teaching.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Statistics for Nursing: A Practical Approach: A Practical Approach
"Can't believe I'd give any textbook 5 stars... But if I had to learn statistics from anyone, these authors are fantastic (Heavey's husband interjects throughout the book). They explained concepts in a readable and enjoyable way. And the companion website is excellent!  It has an audio reading of the chapters (but apparently you have to buy the hard copy of the book to access this, not the e-book).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistics for Nursing: A Practical Approach: A Practical Approach

"This is an amazingly bad book. It is riddled with math errors, it jumps from the authors text to the ""From the Statistician"" text seemingly at random, and the definitions of terms are consistently imprecise and inaccurate. There were times when in her explanations she would would use a chart and try to interpret it, except there was a calculation and result missing that you HAD to do in order for the information to make sense (For example, on pg. 36, question 25. The formula for calculating mortality rate is never given nor explained, but somehow we're supposed to know how to do this. Yup, I Googled it. Good grief!) Her understanding of the difference between an bar chart and a histogram is wrong as well. A nurse who has a Associates degree does not flow directly into a Bachelor degree, nor does a Bachelor of nursing flow directly into a Masters. There may be huge gaps of time in between these degrees, and they may have a second Bachelors after a Masters. This happens!  On the other hand a 6 year old child does flow directly into a 7 year old, then an 8 year old. So charting degrees would go best on a bar chart and a childs age would go best on a histogram. And how do you like this: ""To find the p-value, just look in the appendix chart."" Except the appendix chart doesn't have any data that matches the question. Nice. If you are trying to learn statistics, avoid this book at all costs. The author writes in a campy style, at an 8th grade reading level, which I suppose is supposed to make you feel comfortable. All it does is reinforce the fact that the author is a nurse, not a statistician, and shouldn't be writing a textbook to teach statistics. Everything is made much harder than necessary because you have to figure it all out on your own. Thank goodness for Google searches and the number of University professors of statistics who share their lessons online for free. For just about every chapter, I was in our instructors office showing her issues I had, and she had to pull out ANOTHER statistics book to explain what Heavey was trying to say. That tells it all.

"TL:DR - Pros: Good for introductory students, and self-study review. Keypoints per section, and execute. Mistakes? Here's EXACTLY why!Cons: No laborious exposition on history/theory/definitions needed for later courses, BUT reminds you of algebraic/geometric 'theory' to show you why your problems are erroneous.Review:This is a great primer for someone that's starting Calculus or has already done classes and completely forgotten everything.It gives provides about a half-page of notes and keypoints, as if you just got done with the lecture.I remember in college getting so frustrated getting erroneous answers even using Stewerts Solution manual, chegg, wolfram alpha, AND the internet, and I would still be left clueless, distraught, stressed, and agrevating having to spend so much time to understand what I was doing wrong.This small booklet has got you covered!The book's notes and solution lets you know exactly what they're doing, even the 'trivial' algebra/trigonometry, which was the bane of me, and often provides the most enlightening.This book always lets you know ""hey remember that weird obscure algebraic principle your teacher told you 4 years ago and spent 45 seconds covering in-class"". Well here's why you use it, and how it relates to being operated under derivatives and integrals.Which I think is actually super useful for Mathematical Proofs courses later on, as people tend to have forgotten all the juicy bits and pieces of algebra and trig which this small booklet reminds you of.The book gives you the 'lecture notes' as if you just got out of class and says ""GO!"".The solutions give you such clear guidance for every step, and gives you the ""why"" did you just do that step ""how did you do that"" - 'this algebraic property/identity'The problems are also unique to give you new ideas to think about, as opposed to the 50 same original problems that you get tired and tedious of and 5 random extremely tough problems that you have nothing to connect them to.This book doesn't go over the theories and proofs, and history, etc, blah blah blah, that textbooks use to fill up the pages and bore the student to death to even attempt to read, let alone do the problems.Gives you the 'lecture notes' and says ""GO!"".The solutions give you such clear guidance for every step, and gives you the ""why"" did you just do that step ""how did you do that"" - 'this algebraic property/identity'The problems are also unique to give you new ideas to think about, as opposed to the 50 same original problems that you get tired and tedious of and 5 random extremely tough problems that you have nothing to connect them to.This book gives you unique problems, that give you progressively harder ideas to work with. Definitely not some of those crazy problems in textbooks, but it gives you the experience to tackle those head on.This book starts slightly ahead of College level Material at derivatives curriculum starts at limits. So I'm surprised someone said it's only useful for highschool. The book picks up roughly where my Pre-calc Honors class ended in Highschool.This gave me an excellent crash course and refresher in Calc to begin Real Analysis/Advanced Calculus!

"Just “yuck”! I had to retake Statistics because I got sick and had to drop the class. I loved it before my school changed to this text. This seems to be written more to prepare students to engage with statistics software than to teach mastery of the subject. The authors use definitions to define definitions rather than explaining vocabulary by applying it in the approach to a problem. They don’t explain other vocabulary words that suddenly appear in the exercises but you’re somehow supposed to intuitively know what they’re after. This MIGHT work if they actually explained their reasoning  thoroughly beforehand - or in the answer key to the odd exercise problems  - but they don’t.Instead, when you turn to the back of the book to make sure you followed instructions “a - e” and got the desired results, you’re greeted by “b” being partially answered (apparently it was important) and no input given as whether or not you have managed to correctly interpret raw data into a format that is understandable and easier to engage with for exercise subsets a - e minus b. Or, more to the point of this science,  if you can explain your findings to others… let alone discern if you’re prepared for exams. This sort of weirdness is happening in Chapter 2 which means that it’s going to be a very long term.This kind of ambiguity might be acceptable for graduate courses where one is expected to be able to develop arguments and defend opinions but in an introductory text, it’s inappropriate. I was getting an A last time…this may not be pretty. Sorry if you have to engage with this too. The book showed up (the second time) in good shape.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Statistics

"This book is not a good book for those math students who like to see the process. One example in particular gives a F(x,y) joint distribution function then goes to the equation after performing partial differentiation. It DOES NOT show the steps. If you have not learned double integrals, partial differentiation, and such you will struggle with this book. Even those students who have had those topics still dislike the book. The setup also leaves much to be desired. The exercise problems do not follow the section they relate to. The book ""teaches"" 3 or 4 sections then gives exercise problems. If the publisher wanted to save ink, they achieved their goal. There is no regard to ease of readability or use. If you are a professor looking at this book for students, take it from a current student, do not subject your students to this book.

This practice book promotes and can help develop the skills necessary to succeed in statistics and manages to also address problems in a similar manner to which they appear on the Advanced Placement Test (which in it of itself is no easy feat). Any student preparing for the exam or person just curious about statistics can learn a great deal through working with this comprehensive practice book. All solutions are easily accessible on youtube, and on a channel that is likely approved for use in most schools/districts which can at times be an almost invaluable resource and can even serve as a productive classwork or homework material alternative which could easily be utilized in the case of unexpected teacher absence or simply as extra practice. As a student, I would highly recommend this guidebook to anyone thinking about taking the AP Statistics exam. My comprehension of subject matter and application of problem solving skills has already become significantly stronger after only working with the book for a short amount of time, and the questions are adept in their ability to acquaint and/or familiarize the learner (for lack of a better word) with the language used on the AP.

"I really liked this textbook!  I rented the hardcover, as my professor provided online access to the software (so I didn't need any code) It arrived in very nice condition, and the textbook itself was laid out in a very logical, easy-to-read manner, with sidebars explaining various real-world applications of the material.  Each chapter was laid out the same way, with a colored box containing all of the relevant requirements and formulas and a reminder of what each letter or symbol meant within the formulas.  At the end of each chapter were colored boxes showing you how to perform the calculations using different types of technology.  The author inserted his dry wit at various points throughout the text, which I enjoyed immensely.  Let me put it this way: I'm a middle-aged woman returning to college.  I hadn't done math for at least 12 years prior to this, and I had two years between my first statistics class and my second.  In the first week of Statistics two, it became clear that my last class left off at chapter 5, while this class picked up at chapter 9.  I was still able to get caught up quickly, understand the material, and pass the class with an A, using only this book--no other materials.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Elementary Statistics

"The book by Judea Pearl and collaborators Madelyn Glymour and Nicholas Jewell, Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer, provides a concise introduction to a topic of fundamental importance for the enterprise of drawing scientific inferences from data. The book, which weighs in at a trim 125 pages, is written as a supplement to traditional training in statistics and I believe it fills that role admirably. I was very excited when my copy arrived because I am one of those folks who thinks that most statistics texts provide only the technical specs for quantitative science, not the driver’s manual that is needed by researchers who collect and interpret data. After reading it, I think the book is going to be a big hit with both scientists and practicing statisticians. I believe this book will also prove to be useful support for those who teach statistics and data analysis, because the current omission of causal principles in most curricula is an intolerable oversight we must correct.The book starts off by challenging the reader with the intriguing proposition that data, by themselves, lack sufficient information to permit proper causal analysis. What is required for sensible evaluations of data are causal hypotheses. Clever, simple examples are used to show that if we make the wrong scientific assumptions about how a system works, we can derive very incorrect conclusions from our data. This illustration sets the stage for the rest of the book by leaving us wondering, “What additional set of rules would we need in order to draw causal inferences from data?”Chapter 1 does a rather brilliant job of providing the minimum essential set of background information for the task at hand. Basic concepts such as conditional probability and conditional independence are defined, along with essential quantities and relationships, to set the stage for later computations. After a few pages, the book then departs from conventional treatments by presenting the elements of graph theory as an equally-important set of background information. Graphs, specifically probabilistic causal networks, represent one of the key pieces that has been missing from the field of statistics, but that is absolutely essential for representing and evaluating causal hypotheses for analysis. The reader simply needs to get to page 24 to begin to encounter the unique information in this highly readable treatment. As Chapter 1 continues, probability theory and graph theory are married though the combination of the “Structural Causal Model”, which specifies the variables and connecting functions, and the “Graphical Causal Model”, which summaries the causal logic of network relations.In Chapter 2, in only a few pages, the book presents the core “rules” that establish much of the logic for causal analysis within a graph-theoretic framework. Again, the book is truly outstanding in its capacity to distill fundamental ideas to their basics and clearly illustrate with examples. Following this treatment, Chapter 3 then begins to move the reader into a thorough consideration of the interventionist perspective. In essence, causal modeling asks questions about the outcomes of interventions – “What would happen to Y if we were to change X?” Of course sometimes we have information from manipulative experiments, but the greater challenge is to address this question using observational data and causal rules. In this chapter, the rules of engagement are presented. We encounter new mathematical concepts, like the “do” operator and formulae for adjusting for covariates and calculating causal effects. We also encounter rules like the backdoor and front-door criteria. A central feature of causal networks, mediation, is presented and described. Chapter 3 ends by transitioning from general rules that apply to models of all forms to illustrations obtained through reference to linear Gaussian systems. This final set of examples connects the graph-theoretic perspective with more traditional formulations and examples of structural equations. Here more direct comparisons between, for example, regression coefficients and structural coefficients are made. An elegant and crystal clear introduction to instrumental variables ends the chapter and in the process, links the new material presented in this book with yet another historical body of causal modeling literature. It is impressive to see this accomplished in such a compact fashion.Chapter 4 turns to a topic that will be unfamiliar to many as a formal subject – counterfactuals. Simply put, counterfactuals are questions about, “What would have happened to individual i if they had not been exposed to treatment X=1 (if they had not received the drug treatment)?” This seemingly innocent question, as the chapter goes on to reveal, unlocks much additional power derived from the causal modeling system presented in the book. To begin with, counterfactuals lead us necessarily from the population to the individual level, since these are questions about what would have happened to an individual if a different choice or event had happened in the past. Considering the individual level, we begin to realize that all along we have had unique information about individuals that has been ignored via summarization. With counterfactuals, ignoring is no longer appropriate. At the outset, the reader will assume perhaps that the counterfactual question is an impossible question to answer, even with randomized experiments. If individual X(1) is included in the treatment group that received a placebo, how are we to know what might have happened if they had actually received the drug? Surprisingly, a general solution to this problem is offered using the logic of the Structural Causal Model and the fundamental law of counterfactuals. Following a series of illustrations developed for a variety of situations, the chapter ends with a summary of essential information in the form of a computational toolkit for causal analysis. Clearly, this book goes beyond an exposition of ideas to provide the reader with a functional knowledge of causal analysis principles.Throughout, this lucid and concise book explains concepts through the presentation of multiple, simple examples – a strategy that works exceptionally well, making this the most accessible presentation of this material I have read. The reader will be well rewarded for buying and reading this book and I recommend it with enthusiasm for both practicing scientists and students of statistics.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Causal Inference in Statistics - A Primer
This book teaches us how to formulate the question of causal inference in mathematical terms. It is easier to understand the concept by reading Pearl’s “The Book of Why”.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Causal Inference in Statistics - A Primer
"I got this book because I was interested in causal DAGs after reading ""Book of Why"" and finding it too light on technical details. I'd also gotten ""Causality"" and found it largely impenetrable. This book is much more pragmatic and the writing is much better.The only reason I gave it four stars is that the print copy (purchased September 2020) has serious errors that have been corrected in the errata. For example, the definition of the ""front-door"" criterion is incorrect, which was very confusing. Some equations are missing essential terms as well.

"For a non-statistician interested in causal inference, this books gives an excellent introduction and grounding for tackling more scholarly works such as Peal’s, “Introduction to Causal Inference” or his larger textbook.  The writing is what really makes this book, the authors take their academician’s hats off and just simply explain the topic with good use of examples that are easy to follow.  With that said, the reader needs to be aware that the writing style does retain some old school  academic hallmarks, such as the heavy use of semi-colons between realted independent clauses.  This isn’t a criticism, but rather an observation that goes to presentation style.  At the moment I am a little more than halfway through the book and it is making thing topic accessiable to me, specifically by not leaving out small details, that to statisticians and mathematicians, may seem obvious or not worth mentioning.  This ability to anticipate the students natural question is what makes this book so valuable!I would recommend this book to anyone who has a at least a working knowledge of statistics.  I would consider this book for an upper level undergrad course, and certainly one of the books for a graduate course on the topic.

"This book is intended to be an introduction to causal inference for the advanced statistics major or the beginning graduate student. I am not an expert in causal inference theory but I can say that the text is well written, matches the technical background of its intended audience, is filled with examples which are good illustrations of the theory and contains problems for the student appropriate for an advanced collegian.The sections of the book which deal with graphical solutions to causal inference problems are particularly well written, as one would expect since Pearl was a pioneer in this approach.However, as someone who makes use of causal inference theory on a daily basis, I was hoping for something that would add a theoretical grounding to my applied experience but found almost nothing applicable in this text. There is no discussion of techniques like Coarsened Exact Weighting or Propensity Score Weighting and a fortiori no practical guidance on how to use these techniques. Dr. Pearl does mention that his approach is compatible with the alternative theoretical work by Rosenbaum but he doesn't demonstrate how this is true. Those coming from a tradition which starts with Rubin and Rosenbaum's The Central Role of the Propensity Score will find in this text a completely different approach.The book is certainly engaging, however I wish I was theoretically sophisticated enough to connect this approach with more traditional approaches to causal inference.  My intuition is that most people doing applied work in this field will come to a similar conclusion.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Causal Inference in Statistics - A Primer
"I teach R programming to epidemiologists at UC Berkeley. I have appreciated the explosion of data science. However, epidemiologist are not statisticians or computer scientists. Epidemiologists have a central role is understanding causal inference for protecting and promoting health. Graphical causal models (causal graphs) provide a nexus that connects epidemiologists, statisticians, computer scientists to many other fields including machine learning, artificial intelligence, and even to plain old continuous quality improvement and population health improvement. In public health every intervention has a program theory: theory of causation, theory of change, and theory of action. These relationships can be represented with graphical causal models. Causal graphs can be used to capture expert knowledge from community stakeholders. We now have a common visual language to represent causal systems whether if comes from an academic endeavor, quality improvement on the frontlines of practice, or wisdom from community residents.

"As a beginner to R, I bought this book at the recommendation from Data Science for Fundraising: Build Data-Driven Solutions Using R and am so glad that I did. R4DS provides useful content to get started with R. The book consists of 5 main sections:1. Getting started (Explore)2. Data manipulation (Wrangle)3. Scripting (Program)4. Build models5. Presenting information (Communicate)Here’s a brief overview of each section:ExploreI was a bit puzzled as the book jumps directly into plotting using the ggplot library. Although the authors are clear that the purpose of introducing ggplot is to keep our motivation high, seeing the ggplot syntax without a whole lot of background can be confusing at first. But then the authors do a great job at explaining the various aspects of ggplot. So my advice to other R beginners is to just keep going forward!After the intro to ggplot, you learn about the basics of R, such as variables and functions, as well as intermediate topics such as writing scripts, manipulating data using dplyr, and lastly EDA. This section ends with a good overview of how to use RStudio to saves script files.WrangleThis section starts with an intro to tibbles, which is a new concept for handling data in R. This section is important since most of the functions in later chapters use tibbles, such as reading data from various sources. There are many important concepts that seem useful such as “tidying up” your data and cleaning data points (string and dates).ProgramThis is a function section that introduces data pipes. This section explores how to chain complicated data operations together. You also get to see some good practice in writing human readable code. Then the book jumps into using the power of R as a functional programming language. Once I feel more proficient, I will take a deeper look at purr.ModelNow, depending on your situation, you may not be interested in this section, which is focuses on predictive modeling. There are quite a few recipes that explore “why” questions. Definitely planning to come back to this chapter later.CommunicateThis section is useful because it introduces how to create reusablereports.Overall, this is my go-to book along with the book I previously mentioned. This book is a solid reference book for learning R. Another good thing is that the companion website is regularly updated and you can copy and paste the code examples directly into RStudio. I’m looking forward to further exploring R and learning how to create my own data visualizations.",5.0 out of 5 stars,R for Data Science: Import Tidy Transform Visualize and Model Data
"Wickham and Grolemund have produced an excellent book that would help a beginning R user become very efficient in explanatory analysis. Unsurprisingly the approach that they expound utilises the ""hadleyverse"" a collection of packages (ggplot2 for visualisation, tidyr for reshaping, dplyr for selecting and filtering, purrr for functional programming, broom for linear models etc) that dramatically speed up most of the common steps involved in an analysis. One benefit of Wickham's involvement in these packages has been a coherent philosophy that sits behind them. It can be a little tricky when learning this philosophy, but the long term benefits are enormous.The book is broken up into a number of sections that effectively builds up the ability to ingest, transform, visualise and model datasets. A good portion of the book is available in an online version, to give you a taste of how it is written. Many have been following it as it was written. I have passed on copies of the book to a number of colleagues who were just starting out and the response has been uniformly positive. In my own case I was familiar with some of the these packages; ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, but found the book taught me purrr and how to better use the packages together.Probably my two biggest caveats to readers are that there are situations where packages from outside the ""hadleyverse"" maybe required. The authors do a great job of pointing this out, but it does pay in my experience to know data.table and lattice for example. Both because they can occasionally fit a problem better but also because you inevitably come across other people's code where these packages are used. The other caveat is that the modelling is a little rudimentary. Most of the examples are just fitting independent regression models, whereas it seems to me that a hierarchical model would be a better fit. Still these are small things and it would be silly to expect a single book to cover all of these areas.In short this is the book I would give to someone who was keen to learn about how to use R for data science. It reads really well building up the different components whilst still being a valuable reference if you just need a reminder of a particular package (what is the difference between tibbles and data frames again?). Even though a good portion of the book is available online, it is well worth it to have the full thing on your bookshelf (digital or otherwise). On a broader note with Max Kuhn (author of the excellent ""Applied Predictive Modelling"" with Kjell Johnson) joining Wickham and Grolemund at RStudio, it is a great time to start your R journey.",5.0 out of 5 stars,R for Data Science: Import Tidy Transform Visualize and Model Data

If you look at my photos, you’ll see that I drew boxes around certain words/letters. I had to do this because the printed lines were SO faint that I completely missed it the first time I read it. This made the chapter more confusing than it should have been. I had to reread it a few times before I made out the super faint boxes.

I also wish the solutions to the practice questions and exercises were printed in the book so that I could check my answers.

I have started working through some of the exercises in R and find them very helpful.  I bought this book after completing a graduate course in data analysis using R.  Much of the course was constructed around Hadley Wickham's work.  We used ggplot2 and tidyverse extensively.  We did not use this book in the course and I now wish we had used it as a desk reference.  This book is answering many of the questions I had.  It is also providing an overview of many basic concepts and tools in R and would have been helpful to have at my fingertips during my graduate course.  Google is a great resource, but a well written and easily sourced desktop resource like this is indispensable.  I am learning something new about R constantly...I would consider myself a late beginner to early intermediate user of R for data science/data analysis.  I often find books that cover the basics extremely useful, because its easy to forget.  So for me, this was a good buy - regardless of my skill level.  Others will have to make their own decision.  This book does not cover mapping in R.  In fact, there is a sentence in Chapter 1 that states - this book does not cover mapping.

"I'll preface this review by saying that while I think this book has some significant problems, R seems to be much harder to find good tutorials for than any other programming language or computer topic I've ever learned (I've been a programmer for 15+ years).  I tried a Udacity course on R which ended up being so shallow that I feel like I learned more about R from 20 pages of this book than from hours of Udacity videos.  While I am becoming proficient in R from this book, I think that this book has some problems that have made it slower and more difficult for me to learn R.With the exception of the final few chapters, R for Data Science is informative and easy to understand during its explanation of R concepts and commands.  The biggest problem that I have with this book is with the exercises in each chapter.  Essentially, each chapter shows you to use a hammer, how to use a screwdriver, and how to use a saw, and then says build a birdhouse.  Building a birdhouse is more complex than using a hammer or a saw in isolation, and you may also need additional tools (such as a tape measure), which were never described in the chapter.  It would be much easier to figure out how to build a complete birdhouse if the book first showed how to build smaller scale projects, such as a small wooden box, rather than only showing how to use each tool mostly in isolation.  In that way, you'd get some examples of using tools together to construct something more complicated.Each topic has a few simple exercises, and also two or three exercises which are considerably more complicated than anything which was demonstrated earlier.  While I can figure out the solution eventually, I bought this book so that I can learn R as painlessly as possible.  It's frustrating to spend so much time trying to figure out a problem which I could have figured out much faster had I been give some better examples prior to the exercises.  Furthermore, no answers are given in the back of the book and there are sometimes exercises where a necessary command hasn't been shown in the book (I found a page online where another person had solved the exercises).In addition to the above problems, the last few chapters about formulas and modelling seem rushed and some concepts are poorly explained or barely explained at all (even though those concepts are used in the examples).This book will teach you enough about R to be manipulate and graph datasets and write some simple functions, although it may not give you enough information by itself to solve more complicated problems.  Once you start getting beyond dataset manipulation, modelling, and writing simple functions, you'll probably need another book to sufficiently understand those more advanced concepts.",3.0 out of 5 stars,R for Data Science: Import Tidy Transform Visualize and Model Data
"I got through the Preface and about 60% of the first chapter and had to stopped.Before I get into the review to explain why I had to stop reading the book, it is important to note that this book is available online for free. I prefer print over screen, when possible. But if you don’t have a preference, just use that.Why did I put this book down midway through Chapter 1?Cascade of events that started w/ me requiring solutions to practice problems that are in the book.The only way to learn math and software development is by doing. Books on these subjects should ALWAYS contain exercise problems and solutions to those problems, either at the end of the chapter or by way of an appendix at the end of the book.The best solutions that I found are at jrnold's github page. I quickly noticed, however, that the answers posted on that site didn't quite fit the exercises in the book. When comparing the online version to the printed version (book), I noticed that exercises from the book had been reworded or completely dropped. So from the beginning of this year, when this book was published and released for sale, to this summer, it is apparent that many errors had been found and revisions needed to be implemented.There were so many differences between the online version and the book that I decided to stop reading the book in lieu of the online version.My 5-star Rating:The author does an excellent job explaining topics. He is very knowledgeable and it shows. With the amount of revisions in such a short time, however, I can't help but think that this book was rushed.But if I am stopped reading the book b/c of errors, why 5 stars?

"This wasn't the book for my needs, but it is still an excellent book on R.  I'm not a super user of statistical software and I was hoping to use R for checking for normalized data and maybe running a standard deviation.  And since tableau can pass scripts through to R, I thought it was time to learn it.  I was hoping for a quick ""go-to"" book to look up just the information I needed, but this is a full, step by step course to learning everything about R.It is well written and has a great combination of learning and practice sessions.  If I was inclined to teach myself everything about R, this would be the way to go.  The author has a fun way of explaining statistics and program language that makes it a bit more fun to read and he brings some creative names into examples. I didn't realize it was such a hefty book, it's the size of a full text book.So even though this wasn't exactly what I was looking for, it will likely be exactly what 90% of readers are looking for.  If you want to learn all the ins and outs of R, this is the book to purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Book of R: A First Course in Programming and Statistics
"I almost never write Amazon reviews, but feel compelled to in the case of this gem of a textbook.Quick about me:-solid general computer skills (e.g. Excel), but NO programming background-took statistics in high school, barely passed calculus in college-was inspired to learn R after seeing a colleague use it for data analysis-have been disappointed by R texts that I've encountered thus far, finding them either too advanced or poorly organized/writtenWhy I am giving this book 5 stars:-it is structured very logically, starting with the basics of the language before moving onto programming, statistics, and more advanced concepts-it is accessible to a wide audience, yet goes into the necessary level of detail-it is well written, in an easy, clear voice-an appropriate balance of text vs code examples and graphics-it has effective exercises at logical points to ensure the reader not only understands, but can execute the concepts learned-it is aesthetically very nice -- the spine doesn't crack, the book doesn't warp over time, the font and text size are very readableAs a sidenote, I ordered R for Dummies as well. I didn't give it an especially thorough glance, but quickly flipped through it and decided to return it because I knew on first glance that The Book of R was far superior.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Book of R: A First Course in Programming and Statistics

"I ordered The Book of R largey because I could see from the r-project website (that maintains the software) that one would need a lot of help to get started with this application. In fact, I couldn't even figure out how to download it.The very first book section that is is supposed to help you install R is not helpful--in fact it send you back to the website for R and tells you to ""navigate to your local CRAN mirror and download the installer relevant to your operating system"". What the heck is CRAN and why does it need a mirror?It does tell you that more instrucitons are available in section A1--what it does not say is where A1 is--is it on the website? In the book at the end of the chapter? It turns out its 730 pages later in the appendix, which I did not discover until I had already googled how to install R and found a very helpful youtube video. If this very first chapter is an indication of how the rest of the book explains things, I am in trouble.Another thing to know--as a new user of R, I quickly discovered that RStudio is a must--it makes things much much easier if you are a novice. Yet this book, written for novices, assumes you are not intalling RStudio and are using plane regular R. While the book has a very short section on RStudio, it's not sufficient. So I am now ordering RStudio books so I can get up and running faster.",2.0 out of 5 stars,The Book of R: A First Course in Programming and Statistics

"The book itself is reasonably easy to understand and follow, but it does jump around as one reviewer mentioned, and there are some glaring typos. 3 weeks into an online Stats course taught 100% from the textbook, I have not found myself needing to reach out for extra help.Keep in mind, the full-price ""new"" non-rental hardcover edition is ONLY the bare book and supplemental CD with some additional course material and data sets. It does NOT come with a Pearson Access Code for MyStatLab, XLSTAT for Pearson, or any other product. The CD also seems to require a specific older version of Quicktime for Windows to install; you will be met with an error trying to install without Quicktime, and also if you install the most recent release. I gave up and am digging through files in the disk's directories instead.This book might have gotten another star if I had not found Pearson customer support to be so bad; beyond useless, I would have been happier if they had not had a support number listed. For a textbook that retails for $225 before expensive software add-ons, SOME level of helpful support should be a requirement. I spent the better part of 3 days back and forth with them both over the phone and e-mail, attempting to get information about an Access Code for XLSTAT Pearson edition, a product their Excel instructions that accompany the text claim is available to anyone that purchases this edition of the book. Not a single support rep out of the 6 I dealt with was able to offer one ounce of help; every one of them zeroed in on random keywords in my questions and pasted the boilerplate support response without reading further. My final online interaction was closed out as ""solved"" without even replying to me. By the end, I was basically pleading with them to explain HOW TO SEND THEM MORE MONEY, and the closest I got was a referral to XLSTAT (Addinsoft) sales, who very kindly explained that Pearson is the only source for the Pearson-edition licenses. It's a shame Pearson customer support doesn't know that...",3.0 out of 5 stars,Elementary Statistics: Picturing the World
"My statistics class is using the 7th edition of this book and the MyStatLab. I rented the 6th edition so I could have an actual hard copy of the book to look at rather than use the e-text that comes with the required MyStatLab (I purchased that by itself). I find it much easier to study from a book than stare at a computer screen for hours on end trying to scroll through page after page.This book is pretty much a spot on match to the 7th edition in terms of chapter layout, concepts, and vocab. Some of the practice problems, quizzes, and tests have some slightly different questions from the 7th, but that's ok. I can always access the e-text and get more practice in if I think I need it. I've been able to take good notes and review with the problems. The online homework I turn in each week has some of the same questions from the 6th edition, so this is working out really well.The rental price is def worth it! It saved me some money on a new book and now I have a book that I can take anywhere. I'm not limited to an e-text that requires Internet access. The book I received is in really good condition with only a few underlines and stars in the margins.Thank you Amazon. Taking classes and paying for books costs a small fortune.

Not a fan of math but this gets the job done it’s literally a math textbook what else is there to say,4.0 out of 5 stars,Elementary Statistics: Picturing the World
"First, I want to thank the seller for sending me the most pristine copy of a used college level textbook that I have ever received.  I only needed the textbook and not the access code, so when it came with the access code already used, that was expected.  It also had a brand new unused supplemental CD included, which was unexpected and a pleasant surprise.  The textbook itself is beautiful with vibrant colors, color photos and color blocking of subtitles within the chapters.  The problem is that I found this textbook is more of a workbook than a textbook.  There appear to be very few solved problems with descriptions on how to get the answers.  There are TONS of examples to solve on your own, which is fine if you have a great teacher and understand what you're doing. I found myself being more informed through Google searches than this textbook.  When I really needed straight answers to certain examples in my HW assignments, I RARELY found them in this textbook.  Since this is not the most current edition, I hope the newest version has more explanations and more solved problems with step by step directions.  That is truly missing in this Statistics textbook.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Elementary Statistics: Picturing the World

Required for my bsn program. I loved it very explanatory and provides examples. Only theres no answers to sample questions at end of chapter or for chapter quizzes so you don't get the answer or rational if you are stumped (out of whole book only 2 questions stumped me).

Definitely recommend.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Making Sense of Statistics: A Conceptual Overview
"This book aims to provide a ""conceptual overview"" of statistics.  In that, it succeeds reasonably well, but its introduction to statistical thinking, in its attempt to be gentle to those who are unfamiliar with mathematics, ends up being too superficial to be practical for all but the most limited of audiences.If you have never before taken any course in statistics AND have little interest in actually performing any statistical calculations of your own, this might be a decent book for you.  It will give you enough information to have a general idea of what researchers are talking about when they report their findings and readers in this category will find the lack of mathematical formulae throughout the book merciful.  However, if you have even basic experience with statistics, it likely won't tell you much (if anything) new.  More importantly, if you have any desire to ever compute a statistic of your own, you'll find this book unhelpful.  All but the most elementary of formulae are confined to a brief appendix where mathematical expressions are presented without explanation.  The result is that reading the body of the text provides no mathematics and reading the formulae provides no context, so the reader will struggle to connect the two.  And even if the reader does successfully connect formula to concept, the book offers little by way of mathematical sophistication.Some would argue that, in the age of computerized calculation, it's more important to understand concepts than formulae anyway, and I agree in part.  While rote memorization of mathematical expressions is probably not the best use of a student's time, no conceptual understanding of statistics can be complete without a deeper understanding of the mathematics operating below the surface.  For that understanding, you'll have to seek out other books (personally, I like Chihara & Hesterberg's Mathematical Statistics for the more mathematically inclined, or Gravetter & Wallnau's Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences for the less mathematically inclined, though there are plenty of other options out there).Where this book shines is in its method of holding the reader's hand through explanations of some rather abstract concepts.  It probably would have been stronger had it contained a greater variety of explanatory examples, but the reader is genuinely left with an understanding, however basic, of the reasoning behind a handful of the most common statistical techniques.  On the other hand, as understanding statistics becomes increasingly important in public life, so does a careful understanding of some incredibly subtle points about interpreting statistics.  While this book briefly touches on such topics the correct understanding of statistical significance and effect size, there is a world of subtler points that I think should have been covered.  The reader ought to (but probably won't) come away from a book like this with a strong intuitive understanding of just what the p-value really means, for instance, and how it can be manipulated by the careless or unscrupulous researcher.Where does that leave this book?  It's great for the non-researcher who wants to get just a bit deeper into understanding how statistics works without actually bothering to study the field, and it would probably make a welcome companion for the student struggling to understand the conceptual underpinnings of a first course in statistics, but it can't substitute for a more mathematical text for the practitioner and doesn't get quite deep enough into the conceptual subtleties for the armchair philosopher.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Making Sense of Statistics: A Conceptual Overview
I referred to this book about 25% of the time. Only about 20% of us actually used the book in the class. The teacher explained that it was likely a lot more probable to use it more likely than we probably would. The likeliness of it probably happening was pretty high. There was a 3% margin of error.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Making Sense of Statistics: A Conceptual Overview

"I'm giving this book a four star rating.  It was a wonderful refresher for some topics in Psychology Statistics but just not enough for Graduate School.  It was missing the topics of MANOVA, multivariate analysis of variance and MANCOVA, multivariate analysis of covariance.  But overall, the coverage of topics was good.Statistics can be daunting for many, but remembering that mathematics and statistics are not the same as well as thinking of Statistics as a language are helpful.  To learn a language, it takes practice and incorporation into your daily life.  Practice, practice, practice makes one more comfortable with the language.I would recommend it for an undergraduate Psychology student that needs additional reading for mastering the topic but for graduate students it simply is not enough.
